# /r/houseplants - /r/gardening Classifier
## Subreddit Classification based on Post Titles

In this project, we address a critical challenge at PlantMa, our agricultural startup focused on selling home gardening supplies and plants. We aim to improve our marketing strategies by classifying Reddit posts from two distinct subreddits, /r/houseplants and /r/gardening, based on their post titles. The ultimate goal is to build a classification model that enables us to target our marketing efforts more effectively.
