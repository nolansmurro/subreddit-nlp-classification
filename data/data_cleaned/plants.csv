zoy5pa,1671368595.0,The top post of this subreddit at the moment (embroidered monstera patch) is AI generated. Don't believe your eyes!,"Currently at the top of r/houseplants is a post about a beautiful embroidered monstera patch, sat at nearly 17k upvotes, with the OP in the comments discussing how they used a machine to create this ""physical"" patch.

Someone pointed out that the image looked suspicious so I did a quick search on Midjourney (an AI image generator) and found the source of the image. This is a tool in which you can feed it text or images and it will spit out a completely new image for you, in this case ""embroidered monstera plant patch, hand-stitched nature leaves colorful"" created the image that was posted. (You can see the batch of AI generated images [here](https://i.imgur.com/yBfEi2b.jpeg))

I don't care to come after the OP with this post, each to their own. But I just thought it's a pretty good opportunity to shine some light on the impacts of this new technology. As we're living through a time where it's becoming harder and harder to spot the difference between fake and reality it's important to remember to stay alert.

It's only an embroidery patch at the end of the day, but as all these cool new AI technologies are emerging the scope and ease of misuse increases.",431,7304,0.97,1

zoy5pa,1671368595.0,The top post of this subreddit at the moment (embroidered monstera patch) is AI generated. Don't believe your eyes!,"Currently at the top of r/houseplants is a post about a beautiful embroidered monstera patch, sat at nearly 17k upvotes, with the OP in the comments discussing how they used a machine to create this ""physical"" patch.

Someone pointed out that the image looked suspicious so I did a quick search on Midjourney (an AI image generator) and found the source of the image. This is a tool in which you can feed it text or images and it will spit out a completely new image for you, in this case ""embroidered monstera plant patch, hand-stitched nature leaves colorful"" created the image that was posted. (You can see the batch of AI generated images [here](https://i.imgur.com/yBfEi2b.jpeg))

I don't care to come after the OP with this post, each to their own. But I just thought it's a pretty good opportunity to shine some light on the impacts of this new technology. As we're living through a time where it's becoming harder and harder to spot the difference between fake and reality it's important to remember to stay alert.

It's only an embroidery patch at the end of the day, but as all these cool new AI technologies are emerging the scope and ease of misuse increases.",431,7312,0.97,1

z2h7bb,1669183701.0,Can we not delete any posts and comments saying ‚Äúwandering j*w‚Äù???,"This is the second time I am posting this. The first time I posted was deleted because I didn‚Äôt censor the god-forbidden ‚ÄúWandering J-‚Äú. So i copy and pasted it and just replaced all the e‚Äôs in that word with dashes so it doesn‚Äôt get auto deleted. Please keep in mind that I do not want to do this though.

Edit: to clarify, I am not saying something along the lines of ‚Äúthese sjw millennials are taking away my free speech!‚Äù In fact I am usually on the side of said ‚Äúsjw millenials‚Äù. But this is a different situation, and sometimes different situations are different situations. 

Edit 2: I am also not saying that you should completely abstain fro saying ‚Äúwandering dude‚Äù or one of its variations. I understand that there are still Jews who find the term offensive, and I respect them. But deleting the comments of Jews who aren‚Äôt offended by it and say the word is deleting Jewish voices.

I am a Jew, and I am not claiming to speak for any other Jews other than myself. I so often see a well-meaning person call their tradescantia plant a ‚Äúwandering j-w‚Äù, followed by someone in the comments saying how ‚Äúwandering j-w is in fact derogatory, and we call them Wandering Dudes now ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äù Then a discussion ensues about whether or not ‚Äúwandering j-w‚Äù is in fact derogatory. 

In my opinion, calling it a ‚Äúwandering j-w‚Äù is the least of my worries as far as antisemitism in this world goes. Hell, my family is scared to even go inside my synagogue. But the name ‚ÄúWandering J-w‚Äù is not the reason for that. The truth is, the word ‚Äújew‚Äù is like the word ‚Äúqueer‚Äù, in that whether or not it‚Äôs derogatory depends on the context. Wanna know what that context is? It‚Äôs really simple actually. Ask yourself ‚ÄúAm I being a racist shithead right now?‚Äù If your answer is no, then congratulations you did not just say a slur. A well-meaning person calling their plant a wandering j-w? Not racist. A person saying wandering j-w? Not racist. A Jewish person saying wandering j-w in a discussion about whether or not it‚Äôs racist? Also not racist. But what is racist is censoring and deleting any mentioning of the word ‚Äúwandering j-w‚Äù. I absolutely hate it when people pussyfoot around saying the word ‚Äújew‚Äù. It‚Äôs not antisemitic in the context you‚Äôre probably using it in. I especially hate it when people censor it as if it‚Äôs a slur. I‚Äôm sorry but ‚ÄúJ*w‚Äù doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre trying to be respectful by censoring a slur, it feels like you‚Äôre erasing Jews. And of course Jews are the only ones comfortable saying ‚Äújew‚Äù in these discussions, so their comments are the ones that get automatically deleted. These discussions are important, and if we want to have actual discussions about this and hear voices of all people in these discussions, you can‚Äôt just delete and vilify anyone who says ‚Äújew‚Äù.",1107,4302,0.83,1

Trying to see if my feelings are irrational.


Edit: ok, you are all amazing and I so appreciate y‚Äôall for making me feel like I‚Äôm not crazy for being frustrated. 

My department chair has been notified and we are looking into getting my lock changed. There are a handful of people with master keys, but I don‚Äôt know who they are. There are things way more valuable than plants in my office, so that‚Äôs pretty concerning. 

I went hunting and found it in a big jar of water in a communal workspace of the building next door. I love my plants and enjoy taking photos of them, so I had those to compare and confirm it was mine. 

I took it, the momma plant home, and the rest of my plants home. It‚Äôs a damn shame.

Thank you all so much!!! üíö",396,3186,0.96,1

But for indoor plants:
Just use some flippin pesticides, my guys.

Seriously. I feel like houseplantkeeping online is very much a ""neem oil and three dashes of cinnamon will cure anything"" environment and it's just not working most of the time and doing more harm for people who have subpar growing conditions inside, be it light, temperature or water. Especially to people who are not living in a tropical climate where plants thrive anyway. 

These plants are never going to be a part of an ecosystem. These plants are never going to be eaten by a snail, which gets eaten by a lizard, which gets eaten by a bird, which gets eaten by a cat. There is no biomagnification on your bathroom shelf.

Spare yourself the headache. Just buy a pesticide spray for the aphids and be done with it. Still, be smart with it. 
Except nematodes. Nematodes actually work. Get them for your gnat infestation. Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è",460,1433,0.9,1

But for indoor plants:
Just use some flippin pesticides, my guys.

Seriously. I feel like houseplantkeeping online is very much a ""neem oil and three dashes of cinnamon will cure anything"" environment and it's just not working most of the time and doing more harm for people who have subpar growing conditions inside, be it light, temperature or water. Especially to people who are not living in a tropical climate where plants thrive anyway. 

These plants are never going to be a part of an ecosystem. These plants are never going to be eaten by a snail, which gets eaten by a lizard, which gets eaten by a bird, which gets eaten by a cat. There is no biomagnification on your bathroom shelf.

Spare yourself the headache. Just buy a pesticide spray for the aphids and be done with it. Still, be smart with it.

16zjyq2,1696416682.0,Houseplant Justice,"In but a few hours, I will storm into a courtroom with the fury of a thousand grow lights to demand that my client's collection of 30 year old houseplants be returned to her.

I represent indigent people charged with criminal offenses. Every day I fight to protect constitutional rights by holding the government to its burden. A big part of the job is to listen, work to understand, and tell my clients' stories to show the Assistant District Attorney there is more to the situation than what's in the paperwork.

Here, we have my client with her sister staying with her. There is an argument. The police arrive. It's technically DV because they're related and live together. Someone has to be arrested. My client is taken away. An automatic no contact order is imposed. My client cannot go back to her home until the case is resolved. A mutual 3rd party goes to collect clothes and other personal possessions for my client a few days later. The 8 mature houseplants my client inherited a decade ago are gone. 

My client glossed over this in our conversation. These are most valuable possessions to her name, in both a sentimental and probably monetary sense. She thought I wouldn't care - that I wouldn't take her seriously - if she started talking about the 4 foot tall jade tree or 20 year old Christmas cactus she's been nurturing for years. She had almost not mentioned it. I swear I could feel the plants inked under my shirt and tie smoldering with outrage.

I'm not sure how the case will shake out (the allegations like nonsense tbh) or that I'll be able to get the plants back. But at the very least know that, in some courtroom in some city, a very serious lawyer will be arguing with a DA about houseplants and justice.

Update: 
You're all fantastic. I'm extremely grateful for a community who understands. It's a privilege to be able to do what I do.

Before court, my client provided more information that the plants were sold, suggesting there is a specific person who has them. This was a bit of a relief - client had feared she threw them away. I conferred with the ADA before going on record to express that I would be making an absolutely serious argument about plants. When the case was called, I gave context on the number, type, and value of the plants. I also explained there is someone the complainant sold them to, so there must be contact information. I requested that the court to order the state to assist with determining who the buyer is. 

The Judge was confused at first but then it clicked and she ordered that they do everything they can to assist. I honestly think it helped that the Judge is my neighbor and cannot miss the hanging forest through my windows every day.

The DA was left without much to say (though getting them to actually do anything is another challenge). I will simply hound them until it becomes more work to ignore me than not. I am also going to have an investigator from my office try to find out work on it independently.

It was a general success that changed the focus of a pretrial appearance away from the allegations against my client to allegations against the complainant.",40,543,0.97,1

Another one was, ""Learn how to make the best soiless potting mix!"" and from what I could see on their videos, it was just coco coir, orchid bark, leca, and perlite. And I'm not referring to them selling you their mix, they're just showing you lol.

I remember I also came across someone who was charging $4 for a 10 minute video that ranked the best fertilizer? Another one that was $3 to tell you what the best prop media is?!? Like whaaat? I remember there was a plant influencer that ended up making a program that supposedly had all of their knowledge from the past 5 years, in depth videos, and 1 on 1 support, and she charged $350. 

$4-$10 isn't a lot, but like, why do they charge for the most basic knowledge? I feel like it takes advantage of those who are starting to dip their toes into the hobby.

A year ago that same plant would have cost easily $200, probably more. The same could be said for some of the monstera variegates. 

And so my question is; how can we know if a plant is going to come into a more affordable price range anytime in the near future? Is it simply a guessing game in regards to what plants are currently in the process of tissue culture?

What types did you not care for or you didn‚Äôt understand the appeal - that you now adore? Why?

I was enamoured with monstera deliciosas, rubber trees and rhaphidophora tetrasperma (to name a few). Now I cannot stand them. I dislike the growth pattern of the deliciosa and rubber trees purely for aesthetic reasons (one mature).. except ficus tineke. The only rubber tree who gets a pass. Lol
The R.T. I just cannot for the life of me get to grow happily, despite having *many* fussy and high maintenance plants, this one just loves to yellow and die on me!

I could not for the life of me understand tf everyone saw in hoyas of any kind and why anyone cared about flowering. The grow slow, they predominantly have small leaves, I just didn‚Äôt get it lol. Now half of my collection is hoyas but sadly there are no flowers for me just yet! (I‚Äôm a year into them and all have been grown from water props)

16rr75j,1695646292.0,Hypothetical ‚Äúfree‚Äù plant‚Ä¶am I crazy?,"**Edit: it seems like the consensus is to directly ask the building management ‚ÄúCan I have one of the plants/trees, since it is going to die anyway?‚Äù I am going to do that today. Thank you all for the input!**

Here‚Äôs the situation: I live in a large building in the upper mid-Atlantic US. Every late spring/early summer, around Memorial Day, a landscaping company comes around and does work on the courtyard and planting beds. But every year for the last 4 years, they plant two dwarf fiddle leafs in raised/built-in beds outside the building.

Now, these trees thrive all summer in the shaded courtyard and humidity. But every single year, like clockwork (obviously bc they‚Äôre tropical plants), when October rolls around and we start getting nights in the 40s, they shrivel up and dry out and die. Every year, without fail. I have watched this happen every year for the last 4 years we‚Äôve lived in the building.

Now here‚Äôs my question. I have watched these trees thrive this summer. We had a hot, humid summer, and each tree probably put out 15-20 new leaves and grew a foot over the last 4 months. I want to dig at least one up, pot it, and move it into my place for winter (and ostensibly beyond).

Our building/property manager is pretty apathetic. I emailed her and basically said something like ‚ÄúHey, the night temps are getting in the 40s and the trees in the courtyard are going to die. Are there any plans for them? Such as moving them indoors or replanting somewhere else?‚Äù

And she replied basically saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the landscaping company will take care of it!‚Äù

Spoiler: they will not. Again, unless something has changed I have watched this same cycle repeat every summer for the last 4 years. Trees die in October, are shriveled twigs by Thanksgiving, and come spring the company comes by, rips them out, and replants brand new ones for the summer season.

I don‚Äôt want to watch a 6 foot tall, thriving FLF tree die again for no reason. My wife says I‚Äôm ‚Äútotally crazy‚Äù if I go out there one night this week, dig one out and move it to a pot and bring it inside.

I would spray it down in my shower and give it 2-3 rounds of insecticidal soap treatment before moving it to the same room with my other plants.

Thoughts? Am I really the ‚Äúcrazy plant guy‚Äù? What would you do?",65,262,0.97,1

16pktoo,1695415288.0,Collection size doesn't matter,"Here's my hot take as plant parent of a pretty decently sized collection and starting to get a more plant focused social media feed: it doesn't matter how big your collection is, it matters if it's healthy. I HATE seeing people with 20+ plants that are putting others down but if you truly look at their ""large"" collection they're clearly neglected. Some are browning, dry,  over watered, need a bigger or smaller pot, wrong potting mix, ect. It doesn't matter if you have an entire jungle, if they're not healthy it's just not okay. I despise that some people try to constantly one up each other or invalidate other collectors because how many plants they own as opposed to how much they've grown under their care. You could own one succulent, but it could be the best succulent I've ever seen, you're no less of a plant collector than someone who has dozens. You could have dozens of shitty, neglected plants but that doesn't mean you're better than someone who only owns one. It doesn't matter how many you own, how rare or expensive they are, your equipment, it only matters if your plant or plants are healthy, you are still a valid plant owner nonetheless.

Edit: let me specify, I don't dislike large collections that are well maintained and loved, I have one of my own. I'm saying the people who have big collections who invalidate other plant owners for having 1 or 2 very well cared for plants because they don't have a lot, while their ""large"" collection is so big it's neglected.

16u1kb6,1695861839.0,how does my plan to get rid of thrips look‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm someone that has to physically write things out. Hence the photo. Lol.

Today I noticed thrips on my rattlesnake calathea; I sprayed it down in the shower then put out on my windy balcony.
Then I found them on my FAVORITE calathea (on the other side of my condo!!!) - my luscious orbifolia. This is when I got anxiety. 
I put this one out on my windy balcony too, but never sprayed it down cause I just don‚Äôt want them to spread anymore in the house. I have a cat and I know they spread them around too. 

I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôve been there for 2-3 weeks, probably got in when I brought home my cat lol.
One of the plants was in VERY close proximity/touching a large ficus Audrey, a mini monstera and my hoya kerii but I haven‚Äôt seen anything on any of those plants.

I‚Äôm not in any financial place (or have enough patience) to repot my entire plant collection (30ish plants) - so I‚Äôd really like to avoid that. But if I have to I‚Äôll repot these 2. 

I don‚Äôt feel like having to wipe every leaf down and have to battle them over and over again. It‚Äôs not worth the anxiety. So I will toss them if I have to. 

Very annoyed because I‚Äôve had no issues with pests (with no treatment/prevention) for the last 2years. 

Plan:

Day 1:
1. Spray all of my plants‚Äô leaves with a rubbing alcohol solution

2. Water all with hydrogen peroxide

3. Apply dichotomous earth to all

Day 2:

4. Spinosad (repeating every 3 days)

5. Spray soil with hydrogen peroxide? (or spinosad?)

Watering days: repeat day 1

If there is no progress for a month, I‚Äôll consider beneficials but will more likely just trash the plants.

16yqv0m,1696336834.0,Philodendrons and monsteras are ruining my life,"Not in the sense of ""I can't stop buying them"" but ""I literally cannot water them properly and they die but I still continue buying them because I'm a closeted masochist"".

Philodendrons are touted as one of the easiest kinds of houseplants, yet I've killed all of the ones I've owned. I have a pink princess, white knight and ring of fire, and they're dying slowly and miserably. They're in appropriately sized nursery pots with cache pots. I water them every 7-10 days, drain the excess, and they still show signs of overwatering.

Same with monsteras. I have a monstera deliciosa and I splurged on a Thai constellation this summer. I split the deliciosa into two plants when it was dying, one of them died completely, and the other half is doing ""okay"". The Thai constellation started browning at the edges on all leaves, and I initially thought it was a low humidity thing, but the lowest leaf is turning yellow. But the leaves with brown aren't yellow. I live in Iowa if that helps.

What do I do? Should I chop all of these guys up and propagate them? I repotted them maybe a month ago with a new soil mix and the roots looked fine at the time, but they're still suffering.

Pics of my Thai begging for mercy. Thank you in advance for any advice.

EDITED TO ADD: Would my Thai (and philodendrons) be better off being chopped up and propagated in some sphagnum moss? I'm leaving for a 10-day road trip next week and I'm terrified of coming back to a heavily deceased, expensive plant.

I also should have mentioned that there obviously are signs of overwatering, but when I've waited longer, the leaves curl up from thirst which also isn't a great thing to happen frequently. So like, I know what overwatering is and how I should avoid that, but when I do try to avoid that they curl up. So I guess what I'm asking now is, which is less detrimental?

**EDIT 2: A few people have mentioned they see either spider mites or thrips. Which would explain why the Thai is browning with little to no yellow! So if that's the case (I'll check when I get home) how do you recommend I treat them? I've never dealt with spider mites or thrips to my knowledge. I'm thinking I'm going to chop them up to propagate anyway since they're all doing so poorly, but how would you recommend I treat the cuttings? Pests would make sense because my Thai, white knight, and PPP were all sitting together, and my philo ring of fire is in a separate room and doing fine with the same care.**

I checked carefully after a few weeks when I noticed the leaf wasn‚Äôt starting to wilt yet. But it would still would bend when I lowered my hand. I put it back and left it like that for months. I think 4 months in total but maybe it had healed already before I finally removed the vase/ crutches.

While I haven‚Äôt found any obvious signs of pests, I‚Äôve learned my lesson and will keep it away from all the others until I know it‚Äôs safe.

I‚Äôve gotten really into houseplants this past year and through a lot of trial and error, I‚Äôve come a long way in understanding their needs, but I still have plenty to learn. I have several fussy prayer plants and think I‚Äôve learned their light and soil preferences, but this monster feels like a whole new undertaking. 

How quickly should I re-pot it? Should I split it up asap or let it stay bunched as long as it looks healthy? I‚Äôve lost some prayer plants from splitting them up too aggressively, thinking they needed more breathing room than they did. But this is crazy packed, right?

16nh30y,1695203149.0,This hobby is helping me reconnect with my childhood and mom,"My mom loves plants and she's been gardening my whole life and it used to be so fun to just hang out with her in the little greenhouse she got for *me* because I loved gardening back then too! I was about ten. But around the time I hit puberty, I kinda grew out of it and simply didn't care about plants at all for years.

When I moved out at 19, my aunt said that every home needs a plant, she gave me ten euros and I got a peace lily just because I had to get *something* to avoid the complaints. It struggled and thrived whenever it felt like it and it annoyed me so much. 

When I turned 21, I slowly started liking that plant because no matter what happened in my life (those two years were pretty rough for me), it survived and I guess it kind of gave me some hope haha Like, if a plant can survive my neglect, maybe I'll pull through as well. 

I looked up some basic peace lily care and decided to divide it since there were like three new ones. Every single one, except the smallest one died and I kind of made it my mission to help it survive no matter what. And as it started growing new leaves, my heart filled with joy. You can probably guess where this is going now lmao

Fast forward to now and I just got my 14th plant in my tiny 25m¬≤ (270ft¬≤) apartment. Only half of it gets sunlight from a west facing window, in Finland lol But my peace lily is thriving. Can't wait for it to flower one day. Every plant fills me with this childlike joy I thought I lost a long time ago.

But also, I can finally share my new obsession with my mom and when I was walking in the garden with her, my mind was flooded with memories from my childhood and I got pretty emotional. She gave me some plant cuttings and it honestly made me so happy! 

Just kinda felt like sharing, thanks for reading :) I'm just happy I found this hobby again. I think I'm getting kinda good at it too since pretty much every plant seems to be doing decently and putting out new leaves!

What I'm *not* happy about is my peperomia caperata rejecting my love and care lmao I haven't killed a plant in such a long time, but the leaves keep dropping. I guess that's my next mystery.",4,33,0.97,1

16mi0d6,1695099953.0,Magical disappearing thrips???,"Three entire generations of my spider plants started to look really rough a few weeks ago. A strange malaise was affecting my poor spider plant matriarch and its many babies and grandbabies. To make a long and traumatic story short, it was motherfucking thrips. Motherfucking thrips were inside my home and it was a motherfucking all-you-can-eat thrips buffet, baby. These motherfucking no good thrips were turning my spider plants into the dancefloor from that one scene in the Barbie movie and every night was a party. If you're a nasty little motherfucker about an eighth of an inch long with a bad attitude and a penchant for wanton destruction, you're invited. 

Strangely they weren't very prolific -- I spotted a couple of the wretched little bastards here and there on my spider plants, but all of my other plants were apparently unmolested by these motherfucking goddamn thrips. I guess they were content with the flavor profile offered by my poor spiders. Just a regular bunch of nasty little motherfucking gourmands, I guess. Here's the twist: I got on my hands and knees and inspected every leaf on every plant in my house with a flashlight and a prayer and I found virtually no eggs. Lots of munch marks, but no babies. Not a single motherfucking tot. Maybe they were all too full to fuck. It happens. I sprayed the hell out of everything in my home that photosynthesizes with a persuasively named aerosol called ""Dr Doom"" and a fine mist of rubbing alcohol for garnish just to be safe, and the only pest I've seen around here in days is my housemate. 

What is going on???? Where are all these motherfucking thrips? What have they done with their motherfucking offspring? Google tells me that it takes thrips eggs about 4 days to hatch. WHERE ARE ALL THE SPROGS????? Their inactivity has only increased my feelings of fear and anxiety. Did they leave? Were they impotent? Did I accidentally host a convention for insect antinatalists? I armed myself for war only to be stood up on the battlefield, but it can't be that easy, can it? Is it over? Did I win???",16,30,0.97,1

I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm asking, but I have an inkling that you treat them differently than plants that are not as bushy near the top soil? I may be overthinking it tho :)

I like going through my plants and looking at all the leaves (esp for pest monitoring), but this peperomia is a beast and the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. 

I‚Äôve read that peperomias are semi-succulents, does this mean anything involving roots and space within the pot? I was tempted to repot into a bigger size because the soil wasn‚Äôt budging when I tried replacing to a grittier soil. 

The roots were tiny (like succulent roots) and have just started crawling up the inside of the pot. It‚Äôs still in its original pot with some grittier soil. Should I have gone into it with a bamboo stick to release the roots and soil?

16kzbgg,1694953344.0,One step from binning all of my plants. How can I PERMANENTLY get rid of fungus gnats UK?,"In the last 12 months I have tried: 

\- Drying my plants out to the point I killed 2 of them. 2 plants are currently bone dusty dry and when I tap their bots the gnats swarm out of them and the soil is full of babies. It's causing severe damage to my other plants.

\-Hydrogen peroxide did nothing. It costs a lot of money and I've tried 9% multiple times with no effect. The gnats survived multiple rounds of it over 2 months. 

\- Cinnamon and spice powders. Absolute joke. 

\- Sand on top, gravel and sand at the bottom. I bought thick sand, too. I placed up to 3 inches on the top, 1 inch layer of gravel and 3 inches of sand on the bottom. The soil is in the middle. They dig straight through the sand like it doesn't exist. 

\- Pot covers. They dig through the top soil even if the bottom holes are blocked. As I said, I've sealed the top with sand. 

\- Changed the soil, bleached the new pots. Cleared them out for a short period but I cannot repot my plants once per week, especially when winter is coming up.

\- Poison. Extermination. Whatever killer is available. DOES. NOT WORK. All the recommended ones failed. All the non-recommended ones failed. If you can name it, I tried it. They survived. 

My house is literally SWARMING with them. I live in England so it is quite humid. My plants are dry, full of rocks and sand and blocked at the bottom and they are all infested. No matter how parched, wilted and poisoned they are the gnats live. These gnats have actually killed 5 plants and are stressing my family members. I have a lot of house plants and anything that is not a cactus is permanently and severely infested, even some of the cacti are severely infested. I'm so stressed because my plants are dying and I'm spitting these bugs out. Can anyone find an option that will permanently destroy them? Otherwise I'm going to have to bin my beautiful and at times expensive plants :'( ",146,18,0.71,1

My first foray into house plants and been nursing these Moonlight beauties for about a year after picking up from a home hardware store (see before pic). For reference, the shorter one in the white pot is Atlas and the taller one in yellow is Gladys.

After winter closer to the growing season,  I had to separate and re-pot Gladys because of some fungus gnats and they‚Äôve both been flourishing ever since during their summer season (proper soil mixture, drainage, liquid fertilizer with purified water). But they‚Äôre both growing so tall! Especially Gladys, who‚Äôs not as full as her sister (I‚Äôm guessing because of the pot), whereas Atlas seems to be fuller and shorter.

Every morning Gladys‚Äôs vines are getting longer and I‚Äôm not sure how to appropriately manage that, is it getting out of control? Lol. I rotate her every week-ish and have been training the vines to not defy gravity so dramatically. Also Gladys has had some curled leaves basically ever since I got her and they never flattened out, but retain their dark color and silver hue.

Does anyone have any sure fire tips for how to keep their pets away from their plant collections? My little furry overlord is obsessed with plants and will scale any obstacle to chew or gnaw at the leaves. I've tried putting the plants up on high units or barricading all of my shelves to no avail. I've come to accept that she is the feline version of Ethan Hunt from Mission impossible.  

I've tried using citrus scented sticks but she doesn't seem phased. I know some online forums recommend spraying thenplants with a pepper / lemon scent but I don't want to cause her any upset or distress. At the end of the day she's just following her instincts. 

Any guidance would be so welcomed and my plants will be forever grateful üôèüèª",22,146,0.98,1

I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm asking, but I have an inkling that you treat them differently than plants that are not as bushy near the top soil? I may be overthinking it tho :)

I like going through my plants and looking at all the leaves (esp for pest monitoring), but this peperomia is a beast and the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. 

I‚Äôve read that peperomias are semi-succulents, does this mean anything involving roots and space within the pot? I was tempted to repot into a bigger size because the soil wasn‚Äôt budging when I tried replacing to a grittier soil. 

The roots were tiny (like succulent roots) and have just started crawling up the inside of the pot. It‚Äôs still in its original pot with some grittier soil. Should I have gone into it with a bamboo stick to release the roots and soil?

This plant is the only one that survived from what I bought at that time & it‚Äôs somehow managed to thrive without drainage, also low light due to a house move. I love her! Do Jade plants like to be snug because the pot really is so small?

Looking for any advice how to maintain her - at some point I‚Äôm nervous how I‚Äôll remove without damaging when the pot becomes inevitably too small so I have no idea what to do really. I have snipped a branch to attempt propagating in water too incase that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll need to do in the long term. I may attempt planting a branch in soil too. 

I‚Äôve always loved plants but very much a beginner in terms of learning about propagating & repotting. I may post a few Qs on here over the weeks due to being off work with stress - learning about plants has become really therapeutic & rewarding for me recently.

Checked it and sill rot 2 months later üòë, and only a top cut was viable from it by then, which has been propagated in water and soil the last month. 

From the cuttings I took earlier this summer, they were potted together a month ago.
I would've left them in the 4 inch pot until spring if it wasn't for all the roots poking through the bottom, but they were starting to grow secondary roots and I didn't want to have to damage them getting it out of the pot in spring, so it had to be repotted now. And now I could also fit that top cut I took in the late summer.

Look at them beautiful roots. It's been thriving since I changed from soil+perlite to a chunkier mix, the pothos is an insanely fast rooter, Jesus.",2,7,1.0,1

I am a known plant unaliver.. so far, the only plants that have survived in my care are snake plant(barely tbh, but seems to be doing great lately), dracaena marginata and, as of recently, a few coffee plants that I saved from a pot that had like 15 of them planted in one small pot.

I bought this monstera in the end of july.  When I repotted it after bringing it home, I chose to not untangle the roots. For the first month it was doing good.

In september I did a little research and realized that there are multiple plants in one pot. So I decided to repot it again. I untangled the roots (lost some small roots in the process), potted it in a perlite, potting soil and orchid bark mix(but this mix was not well draining enough), put a pole in the pot for support and also turned the plant in one direction(before it was growing in 3 different directions). 

A week ago I noticed fungus gnats, 2 leaves had turned yellow and fallen off and 2 of the new leaves turned brown(attached pic). 

I realize my mistakes - potting soil not airy enough, it might not get enough sun, pot too big and it tends to get humid in my apartment around this time of the year. Maybe I was too rough on it when replanting. Is it normal to lose roots when untangling?

But is there anything I can do now to save it? Because I am about to give up on it.. I cried when saw the condition this plant was in when I came home after being away for a week. 

Rn I bave rinsed the roots, cut off dead roots (actually noticed some tiny fresh roots) and dipped it in hydrogen peroxide and water mix to disinfect the roots. Now they are drying off.. 

I was thinking about planting it in a better draining potting mix, in a plastic pot with more drainage holes and putting it in a spot with a little bit more sun. But I am just so tired of seeing plants die. Because every time when I try to give them better conditions, they die.

Most ‚Äúveteran‚Äù hobbyists will recommend using systemic granules (active ingredient: Imidacloprid) and/or spinosad sprays. Systemic granules seem to be the easy way out, with the process being ‚Äúmix it in your media(soil), water it in, and let it do it‚Äôs magic‚Äù, compared to ‚Äúspray it all down including all nooks and crannies, keep away from light after spraying, then repeat after a week and maybe another week‚Äù.

Let me burst your bubble. Systemics may help with thrips, but you risk a spider mite outbreak, since the active ingredient increases their reproduction.

177ls85,1697276273.0,about 1 month growth of my monstera and my watering period,"Good day to everyone.

In the photos below you can see the growth of my monstera plant within 1 month, which I bought last month. I bought my monstera from Ikea and located it near the window. The first thing I noticed are brown spots on some leaves. It is not on every leaf, but I think it is because I opened the tulle for the first 2-3 days and exposed it to direct sunlight. Except for the first 3 days, the net is always closed and the light does not hit directly. I water it once a week with about 500 ml of filtered water. I check the soil by hand, but of course it is not possible to measure its dryness, so for now I water it once a week. Its own inner pot is a drainage pot. How do you think the monstera is growing?

Also 3 new leaves have started to grow. The extension roots have not started to grow yet. When should I get that hugging stick I see on monsteras?

Sorry for adding too many photos to my post but I don't understand what's wrong with my calathea, I bought it a month ago from Costco and I have Isolated it, I bought 2 more plants and I have issues with them too but I just want to know what should I do to save it, is it sick ? No signs of spider mites and those gray things I tried removing them and they didn't look like bugs, I tried misting it with alcohol and water for 2 weeks and I tried giving it hydrogen peroxide, I also tried misting it with soapy water, I water it every other week and make sure it's dry before watering, I also added gravel to the bottom of the pot so it doesn't sit in water. Thank you and I appreciate any help.
I'll post my other plants in a different post.",4,3,1.0,1

176l2am,1697154239.0,rant - ready to give up on plant parenting :'(,"**Tl;DR i put so much effort into plant care, but i've had to throw away six plants that were less than a year old. i love how they bring life to my space, but they also stress and depress me. looking for motivational stories (or a sign to give up) + advice about quarantining old plants from my new ones.**

i only just found thrips on my monstera, which i've invested lots of time (and money) in. it used to be huge, then had to be beheaded because it was badly burned, then repotted because it was extremely root bound, and now it has thrips. it was thriving in spring, then started putting out wrinkly leaves a few months ago, then one month ago one leaf's tips started turning brown. a few started curling a little but i thought it was under/over-watering. then was cleaning one of the leaves a few days ago, and realised five of the leaves (which i was OVERJOYED to see sprout in spring) have thrips. 

i'm ready to throw it out (even though i literally just bought bonide and D Earth) because i'm just exhausted. this is the seventh plant i've thrown out this year, and all of them were a few months to a year old: 

* **Calathea Compactstar.** it was also badly burned, i had to chop a lot of leaves off, but spring came and fertiliser helped it grow 10 new leaves. then they all started yellowing come autumn.
* **Purple Passion.** it was one of my first plants and i severely overwatered it.
* **Crassula Hobbit.** it was a gift from a friend who bought it at a grocery store. three months into getting it, the leaves started falling like crazy. i think it was overwatering. propagation didn't work.
* **Peace Lily.** which is INSANE, right????? the easiest one to take care of, but i still didn't get it right. i don't know if i somehow overwatered it - started drooping, i watered it, only drooped more, eventually just gave up on life. relatable, tbh.
* **Pink Polka Dot Plant.** girlie never stood a chance.
* **Sweet Potato.** i put it in a vase full of water and it was sprouting like crazy for 3 months, but then died a horrible death. 

i don't know what i'm looking for, i think i just needed to rant about this. maybe there's no shame in being a bad plant parent. it's definitely taught me a lot about whether i should have kids (lol) and anger management.

**i would appreciate some advice** \- i'm getting new plants delivered in a few days (i ordered them before having this revelation on whether plant care is worth the time......) and i don't know if i should throw all my old plants away in case the thrips spread. my other plan is to quarantine all the old plants in my room and brush all the leaves with D Earth then shower them, and sprinkle bonide (which SEVERELY hurt my bank account, don't know why it costs so much in the UK) on all of the plants to prevent future gnats and thrips.

if you're wondering what plants i have left:

* **Propagated Monstera.** i'm paranoid that they're infested with thrips that haven't matured to be seen yet, but so far they're thriving - even put out two new leaves. one of them is discoloured on one side though, and the other is a little wrinkly.
* **Purple Passion.** it's a singular stem that's slowly growing, but was infested with gnats for a month. treated with sticky traps and hydrogen peroxide. it's looking droopy lately and i'm worried it's thrips.
* **Chinese Money Plant.** it's one of the few plants that's given me the LEAST trouble except the leaves fall off quite a lot.
* **Snake Plant.** the plant that's the least fussy, except i kept it right next to my monstera until i discovered thrips. really really scared that they've spread, especially because my snake plant is the only reason for staying a plant parent.
* **Set of four succulents.** i'm convinced my fairy washboard isn't real because it hasn't grown a centimetre since i got it, but i know it's notoriously slow at growing. the ghost echeveria and gasteria are the loves of my life. but my silver dollar plant also lost a lot of leaves, two stems fell right off and i'm kind of done with it.
* **Global Green Pothos.** low maintenance queen! was one of my favourites but some of the leaves started yellowing and they all belonged to a vine that ripped right off, not really rooted at all. recently repotted it (with very minimal effort tbh) because it came in a pot with no drainage????? and the top started getting white and crusty............also found some mites in it, but according to google they're healthy for the plant and aren't pest mites.........fingers crossed.

thanks for reading y'all, idk if i'm looking for encouragement or someone to tell me to give up. maybe i'm just projecting the stress in my personal life on my plants. my flatmate says it's because they've osmosised (LOL) my depression and absorbed my sad vibes (jokingly, but i think she's onto something). the irony of all this is that i'm dressing as poison ivy for halloween ü§°ü§°ü§°",6,2,0.67,1

The new leaves were quite big and glossy on my ficus elastica and my ficus benjamina developed a thick coat of leaves. Obviously, you can't put every plant outside in full sun, but light loving plants will definetly perk up outside. 

Just make sure you acclimate them properly, or otherwise, all of your leaves will burn up. And if you get hail, protect your plants, plants with big leaves like ficus elastica will get noticeable damage from that. I would know, since I forgot to move mine away...

Obviously, I had to bring mine inside for autumn, I was pretty reluctant on getting them inside though, so some leaves got cold nipped...

Current Care:
* Lighting: Indirect but sunny

* Have never used fertilizer, but just ordered some

17a45z7,1697564956.0,Tips for a low-maintenance climbing vine / plant that can take some direct light?,"Hi plant lovers! I am thinking about growing some vines up the wall above my stairs. [Here's the wall in question](https://imgur.com/a/u15SNGO). The wall is east-facing and across from some large floor-to-ceiling windows, and thus gets a few hours of direct morning sunlight (the light moves left to right so right side will get a bit more). Light for the rest of the day is medium / bright indirect.

My plan is to plant climbing vines in wall-mounted pots along the top of the railing on the wall (or maybe down low by the stairs). Then I'd put hooks or trellis up the wall for the vines to climb up. I'd like to avoid too much damage to the wall (both by plants and by the hardware installation).

I don't have a ton of experience so would like something easy to maintain, robust, fast growing, and pretty / interesting looking, and will provide pretty thick coverage of the wall side-to-side as it grows up.

So I have a bunch of questions!

1. Which plant(s)? It would be cool to do multiple species but I'd be happy with one good one and that would probably be easier.
2. I'd like to get pretty full coverage of the wall, how closely should I space the pots?
3. Any thoughts on hooks vs. trellis?
4. Any advice for wall-mounted pots that can adequately work in just dry wall? I could also potentially hang pots from the railing. Would want to keep them pretty low-profile though to keep the stairs clear for walking.

Almost three weeks ago, 2 plants in the house had a bunch of gray fuzzy pieces. These were repotted a week later, and no growths were present then. Both times, the plants were repotted with store-bought bagged plant soil.

178rre6,1697411322.0,Help! I have a black thumb and am trying not to kill this angel wing begonia!,"[Link to photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/4W7ycN7)

My husband got me this angel wing begonia in June. He said he liked it because it doesn‚Äôt have to be potted and thought the roots looked cool. It came in this container. The instructions were to change the water out once a week with distilled or rain water, which I do (distilled). However, one by one, the leaves change colors  and fall off. It‚Äôs like the green color fades away, leaving the leaf looking more translucent. The front of the leaf becomes pinkish and the bottom becomes greenish, which is opposite from how they normally are. Eventually, the edges turn wrinkly and light brown, then the whole leaf does, and it just falls off. 

I‚Äôve looked at other photos of issues for this type of begonia online and on Reddit, but I haven‚Äôt found any that seem similar. What am I doing wrong? Can I fix it?

I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs definitely been getting too much sunlight. Could that be the issue? We‚Äôre we actually supposed to pot it? Help!",4,1,1.0,1

178kghg,1697391223.0,Hate pests? Here‚Äôs a good read.,"A lot, if not most, of houseplant owners deal with pests at some point, with thrips seemingly causing the most damage. Most ‚Äúveteran‚Äù hobbyists will recommend using systemic granules (active ingredient: Imidacloprid) and/or spinosad sprays. Systemic granules seem to be the easy way out, with the process being ‚Äúmix it in your media(soil), water it in, and let it do it‚Äôs magic‚Äù, compared to ‚Äúspray it all down including all nooks and crannies, keep away from light after spraying, then repeat after a week and maybe another week‚Äù.

Let me burst your bubble. Systemics may help with thrips, but you risk a spider mite outbreak, since the active ingredient increases their reproduction.

Canadians, if y‚Äôall ever go to the US for pest control, get spinosad instead if you can lol. They‚Äôre not illegal, just heavily regulated for personal use, and must be declared at border patrol.

Yes, I let soil dry out well between watering. I rarely water at all.

I grew up in a household of fake plants. On my birthday, a houseplant was gifted to me. At first it was exciting to have one. However I was NOT prepared to be a plant parent. I was told that the houseplant I received can live for years & hardly needs to be watered/ that much sunlight to survive. Ok perfect right? I work 50+ hrs a week & have 2 cats that I already care for. So boom. I kept this thing in my bathroom. MIND YOU I AM TERRIFIED OF BUGS‚Ä¶. LIKE‚Ä¶ TERRIFIED. All bugs. Doesn‚Äôt matter what kind. Harmless or not. I hate em. Can‚Äôt live with em & never have. A month later I saw some weird centepedey looking thing in my shower. Thought it was weird because I‚Äôd never saw anything like that before. (My apartment complex was just built last year so there are literally no bugs ever) ‚Ä¶. I looked in the plant a few days ago & discover little bugs crawling around in the soil. I FREAKED!!!! It was a gift so I fought the urge to toss it completely & just put it out on the patio in a panic. Now I‚Äôm afraid to even go out there & touch it let alone keep the thing. But whatever there‚Äôs a new problem now. Suddenly tonight I‚Äôm seeing 2 silverfish in my bathroom when I came home. The little bugs looked like miniature silvs‚Ä¶. Like I said brand new apartment complex, never saw any bugs here ever especially not silverfish until I brought this plant home. I‚Äôm concerned guys. Do I now have a silverfish infestation? They move so fast I lost them before I could kill them. I vacuumed the bathroom IMMEDIATELY though. I had no clue that plants could bring bugs in. Does anyone else have experience with this? Like bugs traveling OUTSIDE your plants into your home? If so, how did you fix it? Is it really that bad? Do you think a month & some change of having that plant in my bathroom is enough to have caused an infestation or could they just be lone bugs that escaped the plant?

I started off with soil and stuck with it for about 2 years, until I realized that almost all of my plants were rotting or doing very poorly. I switched to Leca and saw a considerable difference in time of growth and roots. It's been about a year for me.

However, I've noticed that I'm hitting the same spot that I hit with soil. I seem to have hit a threshold and I seem to be struggling with my plants. It's making me want to go back to soil, especially after discovering aroid mixes without any kind of dirt/peat/coco coir. I have 3 of my plants (2 syngoniums, 1 philodendron) in an extremely chunky aroid mix and they're doing wonderfully compared to my planrs in semi-hydro. But then I think about it and about a year ago, the roles were reversed, haha.

What do you guys think? Is semi-hydro actually worth sticking to? Does it have the benefits of faster and better growth than soil?

I look at people like SydenyPlantGuy and makes me want to go back to soil, but then I look at TheLeccaQueen or Dana Washington and tell myself, ""maybe I should stick with it"" haha. What's your guys's input?",0,0,0.5,1

Since buying a house a couple years ago, this was the first year I put plants outside other than the ones already planted around the house - generally in pots on the porch.   I have had three hibiscus plants since the middle of the summer.  They thrived outside in the sun and warm conditions.  Two different varieties (don't know what they were called).  Two of the plants had bloomed white and the non-flower part of the plant was seemingly less thick and sturdy than the other variety which was darker green and bloomed in red and yellow.  Anyway, the two white hibiscus are looking slightly haggard as it gets colder and the days shorter.  I'll probably toss them and replace them next spring.  But the red/yellow hibiscus still looks great and I was thinking instead of keeping it outside and eventually getting rid of it, I'd move it inside.

So what's the deal?  I'd assume it needs sun and my house gets good sun, though the days are getting very short so even with good internal sun, it may not be optimal. Placed outside, I watered it generally every other day in the peak of summer, sometimes on consecutive days if it was super hot.  Indoors it would need to be watered less?  

Thanks in advance.

- English Ivy
- Swedish Ivy
- Rosemary (It's young- about a foot and a half tall and spindly)

- A mandevilla / rocktrumpet vine
- Prince of Orange (Coming in)
- Jade plant (Huge old and heavy- probably about four feet tall and shrubby. I made the mistake of not asking the guy I nabbed it from if it was okay to stay outside.)
- Two orchid cacti, shark tooth and unspecified. These are also both a little small.
- Black Bamboo (Pretty sure this one will be fine outside.)
- Banana Tree

* *Alocasia amazonica*: some watering problems. Eventually, it dropped all its leaves. I'd say irregular watering schedule. (?)
* *Alocasia bambino*: The same as above.
* *Asparagus setaceus*: drought.
* *Begonia corallina*: I can't keep a single begonia from dropping its leaves send help.

* *Biophytum sensitivum*: low humidity. Tried twice!
* *Calathea makoyana*: spider mites üï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏è
* *Calathea orbifolia*: drought.
* *Calathea ornata*: leaves burned from excessive neem oil usage.
* *Calathea veitchiana*: drought.
* *Codiaeum variegatum ""Bush On Fire""*: 100% forgot about it for over a month, sorry mate.
* *Ctenanthe lubbersiana ""Golden Mosaic""*: drought.
* *Maranta fascinator*: I bumped into it and dropped it on the floor.
* *Philodendron ""golden imperial""*: The same as above.
* *Plerandra elegantissima*: I messed up the substrate mixture so that it barely held any moisture.
* *Polyscias fruticosa*: Root rot. It was situated in a ceramic pot without a drainage hole, so there was excess water standing inside the pot.
* *Syngonium podophyllum ""pink allusion""*: I have no clue! Every new growth turned into goo and smelled like sweaty feet.

I tend to underwater and water the plant when it's bone dry. I try not to overwater and it has been fine until now. 

I don't fertilize it frequently. 

The plant has been okay for the past 2 years, but recently the new growth are coming out deformed. The new leaves look burnt and I don't know what is  causing it. 

I've looked for bugs. There's no bugs. I've cleaned the leaves and used some neem oil just in case but it does not seem to be helping.

The plant is under a grow light but at a safe distance and other plants around said light are doing just fine.

178kghg,1697391223.0,Hate pests? Here‚Äôs a good read.,"A lot, if not most, of houseplant owners deal with pests at some point, with thrips seemingly causing the most damage. Most ‚Äúveteran‚Äù hobbyists will recommend using systemic granules (active ingredient: Imidacloprid) and/or spinosad sprays. Systemic granules seem to be the easy way out, with the process being ‚Äúmix it in your media(soil), water it in, and let it do it‚Äôs magic‚Äù, compared to ‚Äúspray it all down including all nooks and crannies, keep away from light after spraying, then repeat after a week and maybe another week‚Äù.

Let me burst your bubble. Systemics may help with thrips, but you risk a spider mite outbreak, since the active ingredient increases their reproduction.

Here‚Äôs a good read for those interested: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11172074_Fecundity_in_Twospotted_Spider_Mite_Acari_Tetranychidae_is_Increased_by_Direct_and_Systemic_Exposure_to_Imidacloprid?mibextid=Zxz2cZ

Canadians, if y‚Äôall ever go to the US for pest control, get spinosad instead if you can lol. They‚Äôre not illegal, just heavily regulated for personal use, and must be declared at border patrol. You are limited to 500ml/g (per person, IIRC). There are also a few people that have access to them commercially, and are therefore able to ship you some within the country.",5,3,0.67,1

Of course root rot nailed it and I noticed the stems just falling out of the soil. 

I repotted it in new, dry soil and appear to have saved what was left. In an effort to not have a total loss, I bought this Burpee seed starter kit that holds water in the bottom. Planted up the leaves from the stems I removed.

I started putting my pothos plant out there because it was suffering in our office now that the light has started to shift in winter, but that led to me forgetting to water it as often. One day I asked my husband if I could dump his dirty bong water on the plant because our sink has low pressure and I didn‚Äôt want to have to wait to fill up a cup because I was exhausted from work and would inevitably forget what I was doing with the cup. He said sure, go ahead. In the weeks since doing this, he and I have been dumping his bong water into this plant, leading to a cleaner/ less gross bong. My plant loves it and has started growing huge leaves despite the lower light conditions, to which my husband stated he thinks it‚Äôs because of the nitrates from burning his green stuff.

In the photos below you can see the growth of my monstera plant within 1 month, which I bought last month. I bought my monstera from Ikea and located it near the window. The first thing I noticed are brown spots on some leaves. It is not on every leaf, but I think it is because I opened the tulle for the first 2-3 days and exposed it to direct sunlight. Except for the first 3 days, the net is always closed and the light does not hit directly. I water it once a week with about 500 ml of filtered water. I check the soil by hand, but of course it is not possible to measure its dryness, so for now I water it once a week. Its own inner pot is a drainage pot. How do you think the monstera is growing?

Also 3 new leaves have started to grow. The extension roots have not started to grow yet. When should I get that hugging stick I see on monsteras?

176zxnh,1697207037.0,I potted some golden pothos cuttings I took this summer 6th of September and..,".. here they are around a month later. I bought a medium sized pothos this summer, and found it to have root rot. So I took some cuttings, cut off as much rot as I could and repotted the rest of it in a smaller pot. But still no growth, just a lot of grief from it. Checked it and sill rot 2 months later üòë, and only a top cut was viable from it by then, which has been propagated in water and soil the last month. 

From the cuttings I took earlier this summer, they were potted together a month ago.
I would've left them in the 4 inch pot until spring if it wasn't for all the roots poking through the bottom, but they were starting to grow secondary roots and I didn't want to have to damage them getting it out of the pot in spring, so it had to be repotted now. And now I could also fit that top cut I took in the late summer.

Look at them beautiful roots. It's been thriving since I changed from soil+perlite to a chunkier mix, the pothos is an insanely fast rooter, Jesus.",2,6,0.88,1

* *Plerandra elegantissima*: I messed up the substrate mixture so that it barely held any moisture.
* *Polyscias fruticosa*: Root rot. It was situated in a ceramic pot without a drainage hole, so there was excess water standing inside the pot.
* *Syngonium podophyllum ""pink allusion""*: I have no clue! Every new growth turned into goo and smelled like sweaty feet.

It has been a rough year with regard to weather.  Early spring freeze killed lots of crops.  Tons and tons of rain and high wind events.  Many overcast and/or cool days.  Tons of smoke from Quebec at times.  Due to our weather and high elevation, the plants aren‚Äôt as far along as others in 5B/5A.

Harvested some tomatoes and corn yesterday in advance of impending rainy days.  

A little over 30 tomato plants consisting of:

*Brandywine
*Cherokee Purple
*Black Krim (Slava Ukraine!)
*Sungold 
*Indigo Ruby
*Yellow Pear
*Green Zebra
*San Marzano
*Hillbilly
*Big Boy

1681a3y,1693657771.0,[FINAL UPDATE] Raised planting bed for the Mrs.,"#IT'S FINISHED!!

The Mrs. and I spent all afternoon Monday and Tuesday prepping the bed for the soil delivery on Wednesday. 

This week may have been the hardest *physically* for us, but it had the least impressive results...

...until the very end. 

I think the photos speak for themselves. This thing (I've avoided doing for years) looks amazing! I want to garden in it myself!

What we accomplished this week:

    1) Lined the bottom of the bed with huge maple logs, then smaller logs and then large Western bark chunks spread on top
    
    2) Fixed my busted wheelbarrow. Lol
    
    3) Added pulleys to the tensioning wire for smoother operation. 

    4) Transferred 6 yards of 50/50 soil/compost mix into the bed. 

    5) Planted all the orphan plants (mostly lettuce) that never found a home this year. 

    6) Collapsed from exhaustion.

I'm going to be serious for a moment here. 

 During c0vid, the wife and I started drinking more. Like, a *lot* more. It was starting to affect our marriage and our relationship with our children. 

120 days ago we decided to stop drinking entirely. Since then we have been more active, more communicative and more present in our children's lives. 

This project was the culmination of our efforts to show each other our dedication to our relationship and also to our son and daughter.  

#I would like to thank this community for their eagerness to impart knowledge. Your insights and experiences have helped us avoid the early pitfalls of raised bed gardening. 

    I would also like to thank my wife for being compassionate and loving for the last 19 years. I am proud of the foundation we have created to raise our family together.

Old tires leach petrochemicals, rubber compounds and all kinds of heavy metals (including mercury and lead) into surrounding soil and groundwater. A tire, even partially, submerged in water will kill most aquatic life within weeks. Plants will absorb these pollutants, so eating anything grown next to an old tire is literal poison. Don't even use the plants for composting for the same reason. 

Just like re-using old yoghurt/butter/milk/... plastic pots will leach BPA and micro-plastics after a year of exposure to water, oxygen and especially sunlight. Re-using/saving money is great. But keep in mind there is more to consider than saving money or waste. 

I know this won't lead (hehe, get it) to people hastily removing the tires, some people might even think it's not that big of a deal, but for anyone who is still debating whether to use them or not: **DO NOT.**",367,3001,0.96,0

Here's what I did:

    1) Painted and installed wooden decorative corner embellishments

    2) Put up a chicken wire sub wall to create a vapor space

    3) Put up a rubber bladder moisture barrier wall (I used an old portable spill containment for the material)

    4) Installed solar LED night lighting

The only thing left now is to put down a flagstone pathway in the interior section. I'm planning on going to the patio store today to pick out the stones and get the other materials. 

#Thanks again to this community for being so helpful and suggesting great ideas!

I'm trying to subsidize my grocery costs by growing a ton of tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, beans, corn, squash, cucumbers..... the vast majority of which I'm planning on preserving for my personal use.

Now that the garden is well underway, I've gotten lots of random people, (many of whom are people I've never met), inquiring about getting some of my veggies like my little plot is a ""pick your own"" free farm. One of my neighbours, who I only know in passing, wants to bring his kids over to have a garden harvest experience!

How do you guys deal with these walk-up moochers? 

Do you explain that your garden equates to a part-time job of back breaking, sun burning, dirty, sweaty labour? And putting in a garden is certainly not free as fertilizer, soil additives like manure, fencing, seeds, trellising, water.... all cost money!

Don't get me wrong. I will share SOME with my close friends, but It's not a community freebie!... especially since it eats up virtually all my weekends and on top of that I started some of my veg (celery) in February!",717,1827,0.98,0

The beans and peas are gone down to the stems. They eat just enough of the cucumber and peppers to keep them from growing enough to produce anything.

**I'm not asking for a solution. I'm asking please, from my fellow gardeners, simply for some virtual hugs and reassurance that I'm not crazy to love and rely on my garden this much please** ü•∫ üôè
 
I live in a townhouse for many years. 
 
No one ever had problem with my plants in yard.
 
I take good care of them and I have help doing so too everyday. 
 
I even cut my own lawn once or twice a week. 
 
Lawn cutting crew even said they have on their list from the office not to cut my lawn or do yard work.
 
Yet today, my landlord came over and said the lawn crew is constantly complaining to him because they don't know how to cut my lawn -
 
- (total lie, first because I'm on the no cut list, second because the lawn crew always stops by and compliments my garden once a week during their cuts and never says any problem). 
 
There is a tree about 20 meters away that I complained about twice this year that has a massive infestation of those red stink bugs. 
 
Nothing was done. 
 
A few of them migrated over to my yard and on the fence and I've spent money with successful traps and sprays that are working, but even a dummy know that they'll keep coming back until that tree infestation is delt with (puddles of these bugs surround the trunk, ground around it, and branches). 
 
The landlord is trying to say now that I am the reason the bugs have spread to the neighbors yards due to my garden, NOT the unattended infested tree they're coming from.
 
 Oh, and one of the neighbours is screaming about mice in her house when she leaves her front door wide open 18 hours a day. 
 
Landlord says she should be able to do that in the SUMMER and FALL as mice are only around the outside of houses in the winter. 
 
So he says now that that neighbour is saying the mice are coming from my garden into her house and the landlord is legit taking her side. 
 
Oh, and if I don't cut down my garden to NOTHING in 2 days, I face possibility of EVICTION apparently. Oh, and he just upped my rent to almost 1900$. 
 
No, moving in Calgary is not an option right now, it's literally more expensive if I leave this place this year, it's terrible here for pricing. 
 
Please help me to stop panicking. I need this garden for my mental health, I have been relying on it and coping through shitty life with positive gardening, I can't just cut I down. 
 
I even told my landlord that just right now. 
 
Know what he said?
 
He said he understands how important mental health is and understands that everyone can get mental illness- but still remove your garden now!!! 
 
I feel like I'm going to be one of those tree hugger protesters in 2 days from now strapping myself to my sunflowers and my dog to the tomato plants and my cats to the (vertical, not even horizontal!!) Zucchini plants in protest. I'm not even kidding. I have a physical disability and it's so so hard that I even was able to grow this garden this year, I cannot just up an move either due to it. 
 
I'm not asking for a solution. 
 
I'm asking please simply for some virtual hugs and reassurance that I'm not crazy to love and rely on my garden this much please:(",408,1700,0.94,0

Is this land useless for growing on now?

162ta87,1693149876.0,My garden grew very slowly and never really produced much. What did I do wrong?,"I'm having some trouble I'm trying to figure out.

I started gardening for the first time this year. I have raised beds in full sun with a mix of topsoil, mushroom compost, and composted manure. I'm in zone 7a.

I transplanted seedlings early in the season, but nearly universally my seedlings were very slow to grow, grew at very inconsistent rates, and haven't produced until very late in the season. My eggplants, cabbages, and peppers all only started producing a week or two ago. My tomatoes and squash and zucchini are only now beginning to produce. The cucumbers never really produced at all.

I started most seeds inside, transplanted them in the spring when the various packages indicated it.

For a long long time, it just seemed like my plants were staying tiny. I didn't fertilize until late in the season because I was under the impression that the compost and everything in the soil would be sufficient.

I have a feeling I overwatered the garden pretty much the whole summer now that I've seen my water bill (hundreds of dollars increase per month). It was on a daily automatic waterer.

Aside from overwatering, what other mistakes might I have made that could have caused this? Does this sound typical of too much water and insufficient nutrients?",304,1535,0.99,0

Outta pure rage I started to clean up the overgrown jungle this garden was. It was at a decent point but I needed to plant! So I took seeds that I had for about 4 years. Planted two rows of cucumbers, 3 rows of different peas, 6 tiny rows of carrots, a row of broccoli, a row of butter lettuce, a row of yellow beans, a long row of mammoth sunflowers! I did end up planting 16 corns plants late which I never expected to see anything on! I didn‚Äôt do anything special to the soil, I flipped it and tried to get as much of the grass roots out. As everything started to slowly sprout, I was full of so much joy! I never expected these seeds that were ‚Äúexpired‚Äù to grow. The first harvest of everything was the most joyful and genuinely happy I have been in years! It took me right back to my nana‚Äôs back yard. So I started pickling and sharing the wealth with my family and friends. The joy of watching all my love ones enjoying my hard work and dedication! Was the best reward from this! But to be completely honest it was the sunflowers that brought me the most joy! The bloom right in time for my birthday! They were 9ft tall! I I have two plant them twice and I didn‚Äôt get many of them, but the few I got made the end of the garden season to a beautiful joyous moment! I got way more ‚Äúexpired‚Äù seeds and I am going to try and really organize how I grow things next year! I really look forward to doing this all over again!

I live in a townhouse for many years. 
 
No one ever had problem with my plants in yard.
 
I take good care of them and I have help doing so too everyday. 
 
I even cut my own lawn once or twice a week. 
 
Lawn cutting crew even said they have on their list from the office not to cut my lawn or do yard work.
 
Yet today, my landlord came over and said the lawn crew is constantly complaining to him because they don't know how to cut my lawn -
 
- (total lie, first because I'm on the no cut list, second because the lawn crew always stops by and compliments my garden once a week during their cuts and never says any problem). 
 
There is a tree about 20 meters away that I complained about twice this year that has a massive infestation of those red stink bugs. 
 
Nothing was done. 
 
A few of them migrated over to my yard and on the fence and I've spent money with successful traps and sprays that are working, but even a dummy know that they'll keep coming back until that tree infestation is delt with (puddles of these bugs surround the trunk, ground around it, and branches). 
 
The landlord is trying to say now that I am the reason the bugs have spread to the neighbors yards due to my garden, NOT the unattended infested tree they're coming from.
 
 Oh, and one of the neighbours is screaming about mice in her house when she leaves her front door wide open 18 hours a day. 
 
Landlord says she should be able to do that in the SUMMER and FALL as mice are only around the outside of houses in the winter. 
 
So he says now that that neighbour is saying the mice are coming from my garden into her house and the landlord is legit taking her side. 
 
Oh, and if I don't cut down my garden to NOTHING in 2 days, I face possibility of EVICTION apparently. Oh, and he just upped my rent to almost 1900$. 
 
No, moving in Calgary is not an option right now, it's literally more expensive if I leave this place this year, it's terrible here for pricing. 
 
Please help me to stop panicking. I need this garden for my mental health, I have been relying on it and coping through shitty life with positive gardening, I can't just cut I down. 
 
I even told my landlord that just right now. 
 
Know what he said?
 
He said he understands how important mental health is and understands that everyone can get mental illness- but still remove your garden now!!! 
 
I feel like I'm going to be one of those tree hugger protesters in 2 days from now strapping myself to my sunflowers and my dog to the tomato plants and my cats to the (vertical, not even horizontal!!) Zucchini plants in protest. I'm not even kidding. I have a physical disability and it's so so hard that I even was able to grow this garden this year, I cannot just up an move either due to it. 
 
I'm not asking for a solution.

16zvsy0,1696446686.0,My garden journey!,"I have grown up around gardens! I had a little one once only grew some peas and sunflowers, nothing to this scale! Outta pure rage I started to clean up the overgrown jungle this garden was. It was at a decent point but I needed to plant! So I took seeds that I had for about 4 years. Planted two rows of cucumbers, 3 rows of different peas, 6 tiny rows of carrots, a row of broccoli, a row of butter lettuce, a row of yellow beans, a long row of mammoth sunflowers! I did end up planting 16 corns plants late which I never expected to see anything on! I didn‚Äôt do anything special to the soil, I flipped it and tried to get as much of the grass roots out. As everything started to slowly sprout, I was full of so much joy! I never expected these seeds that were ‚Äúexpired‚Äù to grow. The first harvest of everything was the most joyful and genuinely happy I have been in years! It took me right back to my nana‚Äôs back yard. So I started pickling and sharing the wealth with my family and friends. The joy of watching all my love ones enjoying my hard work and dedication! Was the best reward from this! But to be completely honest it was the sunflowers that brought me the most joy! The bloom right in time for my birthday! They were 9ft tall! I I have two plant them twice and I didn‚Äôt get many of them, but the few I got made the end of the garden season to a beautiful joyous moment! I got way more ‚Äúexpired‚Äù seeds and I am going to try and really organize how I grow things next year! I really look forward to doing this all over again! I really hope some one actually fully reads this and enjoys all my photos! As much as I do! Any tips! Tricks! Ideas! I‚Äôm open for them :)",153,1325,1.0,0

Advice needed,"Hi all - this tree is in my (currently unkept) back garden which has been neglected due to a big building project on the house and now needs proper planning. My apps tell me it‚Äôs a Japanese red cedar although I‚Äôm not too convinced as some images don‚Äôt seem to match. However it‚Äôs become quite wide and I‚Äôm not sure whether to prune it or chop it down (we‚Äôve two free surgeons come look at it and both just wanted to chop it down and I soon realised they were just focused on getting the bigger price for that!) There‚Äôs obviously no right answer but I‚Äôm curious what others would do. The garden is south facing and it does block some light to the garden but mostly against the back wall which you can see although even with it gone it wouldn‚Äôt be a sun trap there. I do like the privacy it gives me as there is a 2 storey house directly behind however I could replace it would some 8ft-ish trees to at least give privacy to their lower floor. I have a little girl and imagined putting a swing on a branch for her however one branch did come down in a recent storm and I‚Äôm wondering whether replacing with a climbing frame is more practical. One main sticking point is I‚Äôve read you can‚Äôt easily prune conifers as the needles only grow from  where the needles already are - so for example as the branches have only the needles on the end as they keep growing out they get too long and if I cut a branch in half to expose just a woody end then no new needles grow, so in theory you‚Äôre always just having to tip prune. I can‚Äôt get a straight answer on this but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read so curious on others‚Äô thoughts here! Thanks!",214,431,0.88,0

The shop owner says she is a stay-at-home mom with a big interest in plants. She says all the plants and flowers in her items are handpicked and dried.

From what I can see she has sold 80+ items with these four-leaf clovers. Considering that this species can typically be expected to have just one four-leaf clover in every 10,000, 80+ seems like a big number to me.

16s0oph,1695668428.0,Lost the sun in 1/3 of my garden,"The shifting fall sun has caused me to lose sunlight in a large portion of my garden and I‚Äôm at a total loss for what to do. In spring I moved my garden setup to this area on the south side of my house. I took extensive measurements of the sunlight at all parts of the space every hour of the day in both mid May and June to help determine where to plant everything. But I did not take into account that the sun would move lower behind my neighbors annoying 3-story house and block a third of my garden ALL DAY.

This picture was taken around noon, and I‚Äôve tracked the sun again from 7am to 6pm and the left side gets no bright, direct sunlight all day. It‚Äôs pretty sad because my pepper plants all ended up in that far left corner, and have produced very little this month. When they were planted, that area got 7-8 hours of sun a day. 

We‚Äôre in zone 5b, Denver area, so I figure it‚Äôs way too close to first frost to spend time trying to move or fix anything. So this season is probably a loss. But I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any tips for next season. Anything that I could plant there that could tolerate sun in July/August and shade in September? Or should I only use that area for cool weather plants and leave it empty in the hottest month? Or should I consider relocating some of my garden boxes all together?",43,237,0.96,0

I currently live in condo with only a front patio to garden with so everything has to be container friendly unfortunately.

Are there any edible plants that no one would guess that can be grown in flowerbed containers or larger grow bags??

For example, I thought no way you could be able to grow pumpkins in a container and I just recently found out you can grow ones that have been modified for container gardens!!

I would love to hear more recs from seasoned gardeners who would say what other plants beginners would never guess that can be grown in patio containers and which ones are worth growing in such limited space.

Thanks!! May you all have a lovely day üòä

I haven‚Äôt grown tomatoes for years (back when I lived in Ohio)

I got a 32‚Äù (80cm) deep raised bed, and prepared it with logs, branches, sticks, dried leaves, topped with about 18‚Äù (45cm) of dirt ‚Äúfor raised beds‚Äù

May 25th I planted a Better Boy, Cherokee Red, Beefsteak, and a small yellow pear tomato plant (from Lowe‚Äôs or Home Depot). 

Also planted a couple peppers and one cucumber (we thinned the cucumber regularly, but it got away from us a couple times).

Of the tomatoes, only the yellow pear has been prolific over the summer. I‚Äôve blamed that on overcrowding/shade from the cucumber. 

Now that it‚Äôs the end of September, I‚Äôve got tons of green tomatoes on each plant! 

It has been cooler this month, mostly staying in the 70s (20-26c), average temperature in October is 72 (22c).

16u0yby,1695860266.0,Anything I can do about neighbor‚Äôs trees of heaven?,"About 3 years ago, my neighbor, Ron, claimed my labradoodle, Sadie, was petrifying to his daughters (teenagers), when Sadie was still a puppy. My wife and I were already planning on fencing in the backyard, so I reassured him Sadie‚Äôs reign of terror would soon end.

A few months after fencing in the yard, Ron texted me. Which is weird because I forgot I even gave him my number. But weirder because he texted me, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre you planning on doing with your backyard?‚Äù After pondering his rationale of asking such a thing, I replied that we would keep up with the lawn (yea, it‚Äôs due for a mow, but it‚Äôs been raining practically every weekend this summer + I have a toddler that wants my undivided attention = daughter over lawn), let our arborvitae‚Äôs plotted along our back fence grow out (Ron‚Äôs house is on my left), and keep a garden bed (directly below his now impeding and growing TOH‚Äôs pictured). He replied something about how much easier it is to cover the back half of the yard off with tarp because it‚Äôs not worth keeping up with. Believe it or not, at the time, the back of his yard was not too shabby.

For reference, we live in a relatively busy suburban area, on a steep hill above one of our city‚Äôs main roads. The steep hill separating us from the main road also takes up the back half of Ron and I‚Äôs backyards (see the big dips in the fencing). So I get where he was coming from about essentially giving up on the back part of the yard. It can be a pain in the ass to maintain. However, I didn‚Äôt think he actually would let his go to the point where it‚Äôs riddled with such invasiveness. Especially after I told him I disagreed with his suggestion.

Which leads me here, looking for advice on what I can do to not let Ron‚Äôs heavenly yard ruin mine. Only things I can think of are probably not legal. And I‚Äôm not really looking to go to small claims court with Ron over it either. No time for that with the wife and I both working, having a toddler, and another baby on the way‚Ä¶

Willing to slightly bend moral ethics, but again, trying to keep it legal. Not because I‚Äôm an outstanding citizen, more that I know Ron has called the cops insisiting his house was broken into.

The big tree is not in that area, the small tree is. I do not want to relocate the small tree, but if it could happen for the right idea. The planter and the fire ring can be re/moved. I want to maintain a fire ring and it must be 10 feet from the garage and deck, however I would sacrifice it begrudgingly for efficiency. My zone is 4a according to google (Red Wing, MN). I volunteer at a food shelf and can donate all the food I grow, so super growers like zucchini are cool in large numbers. I‚Äôm also going to be eating from these so variety is appreciated. My neighborhood is plagued with dirty little bunnies, so there‚Äôs that. This area gets full sun. 

Me: 42, retired, can perform strenuous physical tasks, can easily carry 50 dog food bags. Grug, but can follow directions gud. I have had a garden of various sizes for 5 seasons. I successfully grew cukes, zucchini, squash, and dill. I tried growing romanesco broccoli but it only grew leaves. That is my experience growing things to completion. I am ready to invest 3-4 hours per day maximum to this endeavor.

The mission: using the information above how would you spend 1500-2000$ US (maybe a little more if it means feeding a lot more people) if you were setting up a garden? Is it possible to do something that will grow veggies all year? 

Bonus: there‚Äôs a 12 foot by 12 foot area behind the garage that gets full shade. Is there anything I could bring to the food shelf that grows in full shade in area 4a?

I bought a house about 3 years ago with a large, mature avocado tree in the yard. It is probably 20-30 years old, although possibly older. It produces an absolutely insane harvest every year of avocados that are nothing short of amazing. Here is a list of their qualities:

- They are huge, like up to the size of a football huge. 2-3 lbs per avo is pretty standard, but occasionally I have one that's over 4lbs. I am going to start being better about weighing them because I think there's been a couple that were 5lbs but I didn't weigh it. People are happy to pay $3-4 per avo on my roadside stand. 

- They have a small seed relative to their size. Even one of the smaller avocados will produce 3+ cups of mashed fruit. The tree produces around 100 mature fruits over a 2-3 month period.  

- They DON'T BROWN. I can make guacamole and it lasts in the fridge for over a week with zero browning. This is the main thing that I feel could make it a commercially successful avo. 

- They have a delicious, creamy texture with a rich buttery flavor. No stringyness, and the flesh has an attractive golden hue when fully ripe. 

- They can be picked early and last for several weeks before ripening. Once they start to ripen, they have a 2-3 day window of peak ripeness. You can refrigerate them at that point and they will stay perfect for more than a week with no reduction in flavor or texture quality. 

- The tree is deciduous and drops all of its leaves in January which seems to protect it from the avocado lace bug. My neighbor's avo tree is heavily impacted by it. 


I'm in Hawaii so we are in the land of great and unique avocados. But this one really does seem like it has all the qualities you want in an avo. I live on a really small lot, so trying to graft and farm this tree on my own property isn't an option. I just feel like this avo could be a contender for a successful commercial crop. But I don't have any experience farming. I know avos need to be grafted once you find a good tree. Seems like the only commercial variety is Hass these days, but this avo seems to me to be superior in every way. Is there such thing as avocado licensing lol?

In July, I got the seeds and grew it in a coco peat mix for 2 weeks and once it grew a bit long and started having 3-4 leaves, I planted it in a hydroponics setup I build myself. It‚Äôs been atleast 100 days and I am yet to see a bulb form on it even though it has a lot of leaves and decent stalk size and I don‚Äôt have any clue why.

I am from India and the months of July was probably warmer than what broccoli needs, but I went at it anyway. Also at one point there was a rat eating the top portion of the plant, I had that dealt with. Anything I can do to get the plant to grow bulbs and eventually get some broccoli.

Last year, I planted four seedlings of common yellow passion fruit, but only one plant survived. Now, this plant is bearing fruit, but all the fruits are showing shades of pink/red in addition to yellow. The fruit's interior is normal, and the taste is also normal, perhaps slightly less tart. All the seedlings I planted were from a common yellow passion fruit plant. I'm curious, can anyone tell me what might have happened? Is it possible that my passion fruit plant underwent some mutation? Or could it be due to the soil composition? I'm not sure if this information is relevant, but the reason this one survived among the four seedlings is that I applied a scorpion poison that was more concentrated than it should have been.

First year gardening, and outside of the abject failure of our carrots and onions, everything else was fair to call a success. Particularly, as you can see, the tomatoes. And as much as we love tomatoes, we're definitely going to need to find some folks to offload some of these.

The varieties we grew were Italian Roma, Roma VF, San Marzano, and Beefsteak. Both Roma varieties were the most vigorous and provided the most consistent harvest. San Marzano were pretty good. Beefsteak proved the most difficult, being prone to splitting and slow to grow and rippen.

We additionally grew green beans of the Harvester Bush variety, which were awesome and produced like mad...until the grasshoppers came. I have made mortal enemies of these creatures.

And, most interestingly, we had a volunteer pumpkin plant! You can look back in my post history where I sought an ID for a mystery plant that appeared in spring. I thought it a unique looking weed at first and decided to let it be, where it eventually sprawled several meters from its little corner of the bed.

I'm not so great with gardening and have a lot of indoor plants. This tree came with the house, and I loved it very very much. I dont think it can really grow back properly as there's no branches left, just some tiny baby side shoots,  and its the complete wrong time of year to do a serious chop in general. But maybe I'm underestimating how fast it can grow.
Please advise?",92,197,0.97,0
1798etn,1697469466.0,Any recs for an edible garden that most people wouldn‚Äôt think they can grow in a container??,"Hi there!

I currently live in condo with only a front patio to garden with so everything has to be container friendly unfortunately.

Are there any edible plants that no one would guess that can be grown in flowerbed containers or larger grow bags??

For example, I thought no way you could be able to grow pumpkins in a container and I just recently found out you can grow ones that have been modified for container gardens!!

I would love to hear more recs from seasoned gardeners who would say what other plants beginners would never guess that can be grown in patio containers and which ones are worth growing in such limited space.

Thanks!! May you all have a lovely day üòä

I am from India and the months of July was probably warmer than what broccoli needs, but I went at it anyway. Also at one point there was a rat eating the top portion of the plant, I had that dealt with. Anything I can do to get the plant to grow bulbs and eventually get some broccoli.

First year gardening, and outside of the abject failure of our carrots and onions, everything else was fair to call a success. Particularly, as you can see, the tomatoes. And as much as we love tomatoes, we're definitely going to need to find some folks to offload some of these.

The varieties we grew were Italian Roma, Roma VF, San Marzano, and Beefsteak. Both Roma varieties were the most vigorous and provided the most consistent harvest. San Marzano were pretty good. Beefsteak proved the most difficult, being prone to splitting and slow to grow and rippen.

We additionally grew green beans of the Harvester Bush variety, which were awesome and produced like mad...until the grasshoppers came. I have made mortal enemies of these creatures.

And, most interestingly, we had a volunteer pumpkin plant! You can look back in my post history where I sought an ID for a mystery plant that appeared in spring.

Back Row - Holy Basil (Green & Purple: Ram and Krishna)

Front Row - Left Side - Marigold

Front Row - Right Side - Holy Basil and Cilantro

Seedling Case - Marigold Seedlings (50-70x)

Black Pot - More Holy Basil

The reason for having so many Basil plants, is that I want to have enough to produce thousands of tulsi seeds because I need it every year. But! It‚Äôs also super invasive because it‚Äôs seeds always fall off and fly away. So I transplanted the invasive seedlings into the black temporary pot. The Marigolds are the quickest to germinate in my stock right, with less than roughly 2 days for it to start.

Cilantro are also my fast germinators, but only if wettened.

Also getting into strawberry. I ordered 4 strawberry plants, which came as 8, but dormant and are starting to shine again.

Small pots on the bottom are just transplanted marigolds and trial at having more cilantro.

3. Have planted 3 pots of spring onions, they grow so fast! (I use these a lot, so it's good to have hoke grown)
4. My last rubber plant died, so  I got a new one last month. I have been taking really good care of it, after lots of research, the baby is thriving.
5. I learned how to make home made neem water as organic pesticides, and it's working so well.
6. I found earthworms in a nursery, so got some to add to outdoor soil. I added a layer of mulch to it, food for the worms. Hopefully after 90 days I shall have my very own vermi compost
7. I planted 6 asiatic lilies, the bulbs grew into tall plants within 19 days, waiting for them to blossom. 
8. I have 4 huge aloe plants that I plan on using for skincare and haircare.

Frankly I'm addicted to gardening now. It's so therapeutic. Nurturing the plants, watching them thrive, I feel sense of pride.

So my mom planted two amaryllis bulbs in this pot a few years back. This was soon forgotten and neglected. It had greenery and it did let out one or two flowers every now and then. It looked overcrowded, as you can see in pictures 1 and 2.

I was gonna throw it out and plant something else but thought to myself why not try to separate the bulbs for the hell of it. So I did. Turns out there were 92 bulbs of varying shapes and sizes in the pot, as seen in pictures 3-5 (picture 5 is of the smallest one I found).

I have absolutely no experience with amaryllis. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do with these? (as in like do I plant them in individual pots? Do I do something before I plant them? Again, no experience whatsoever with this) Their roots were incredibly tangled so I had to cut and rip. 

Also if anyone can tell me what those growths in pictures 6 and 7 are, would be much appreciated.",9,7,0.89,0

I said thanks very much but I I intend too eat my chestnuts. SO  I gathered a few of them in the mountains but now I don‚Äôt know how to plant them, as anyone ever planted them from seed aka ‚Äúchestnuts fruits ‚Äú how would you recommend I proceed ? 
- temperature I need to make them germinate
- potting soil mix ecc.
I would be so thankful since I‚Äôd love to try and have one or more chestnut trees on my farm.
I‚Äôm a bit on the cannibal side since my surname is indeed chestnut in Italian but you guys don‚Äôt mind, right? lmao

174zj00,1696980602.0,Dill seedlings: too leggy? crowded? Next suggestions?,"Hi. Growing dill from seed in a pot that is a foot or so tall, and almost 1.5 ft in diameter.  Around 8 days since sprouting from seed

May i ask:
Are these dill seedlings too leggy?  It rains a lot here so i need to put them under a glass roof and they may not be getting too much direct sunlight.  They r out in the open whole day though

Are they too crowded for now?  I am planning to thin them out at some point but not sure when.  Was thinking once true leaves come out and if they start pushing each other's leaves

Any other suggestions? 

I tried growing dill in 2 inch deep mini posts before but after a week or so in this stage they died off.  I figured they were indoors before and pots were too shallow.  Tried large pot this time and deeper.   Had dead batch of earlier seeds so i just over planted this time i guess. 

Looking forward to more dill :)

I bought some from our local plant center and they looked alive and beautiful when I brought them home last October 9th. However, I noticed that in the evening the flowers started wilting and in the days to follow, some of the leaves started turning brown and crispy. 

I'm just worried about her. I was anticipating some shock from being moved from one location to another (it's why I held off on immediately repotting her from the nursery bag she was in to the bigger pot I got) but I've been watering her every morning and making sure the soil in her nursery bag is damp. 

I live in a tropical country and it can get pretty hot. I'm trying (and struggling ) to find the balance between watering enough to keep it happy and healthy and not overwatering that I cause it root rot. 

Earlier today I saw that more leaves had gotten scorched so I was thinking maybe it's getting too much sun so I've moved it somewhere it'll only get sun until around 9 am. 

I've given its soil some humic plus and also the other day sprayed a bit of plant food on the underside of its healthy leaves (they're still okay) but the scorched/brown and crispy i left alone. 

Should I transplant it to a bigger pot? Should I snip off the crispy brown leaves? 

Any help or advice is appreciated. I don't want to kill my first hydrangea ü•≤

17509mn,1696982625.0,"Keeping Haskaps over winter, no dormancy period, thoughts?","So, we rescued some hurting haskaps (Honeyberry) from a neighbor who hadn't watered them. They nearly died, shed all their leaves and were looking pretty sad. We managed to save them with water and shade but now they are putting out tiny new leaves and showing signs of life just as it's getting cold outside. We are in 5b, so winter is just around the corner and these little guys are emerging like it's springtime.

Now the big question. Do we try and overwinter these plants indoors to let them recover a bit or is the smart move to allow them to go dormant with the weather change and hope they make it through to next spring. The ground isn't frozen yet so they could be planted out, but I'd be afraid the transplant shock would kill them just as they're coming back to life. On the other hand, letting them freeze in pots may very well do the same.

Quite the conundrum.

Other pollinators too, but these are my favorite. I like to photograph them, and I just overall like seeing them. I'm trying to keep the footprint fairly small at the moment.

This is my current plant list. Mostly based on plants I've seen a lot of native bees and wasps on. My soil is acidic heavy clay. Whatever you imagine when you read that, it's significantly heavier clay than that. 


- Chaste tree - probably planted separately to avoid shading everything else out. Attracts lots of bees
- high bush blueberry - for the blueberry digger bees.
- goldenrod - slender and seaside varieties. 
- swamp milkweed and tuberosa milkweed - can't not include this.
- Honeycomb buddleia
- coral bells azalea for a border. I'd like to change this to something else as they don't really get much bee traffic. They are a cheap (frequently $5 per small plant after they drop blooms), neat looking, evergreen plant that will reduce the weedy look though, which is important.
- sterile lantana variety - same purpose as the azaleas. Another one that I wouldn't mind substituting, they really don't attract many insects considering the huge number of flowers - they are very easy to shape though, and they thrive in my crappy soil.

The azaleas (or their replacement), milkweeds and goldenrod, I plan to load up on. The lantana too, but to a lesser degree. Everything else will be single specimens except for the blueberries, which I already have 2-3 of and will be transplanting. 

I was hoping for suggestions on an alternative to the azaleas and lantana, and anything that fills blooming time gaps. I think early spring and late summer might be kind of light. Thanks for any help!",3,2,1.0,0

The person we bought it off said it can only grow to 4 metres and that it is a one of the slower growing types. The bamboo is filled with moulded areas where the leaves meet the stem. Half the stems are yellowed and their isn‚Äôt much consistency or symmetry in growth. 

The other issue is that they‚Äôre attracting wasps. So now I have a bamboo cemetery with flying pain extractors. I was also looking for recommendations on plants (I saw natives were suitable) that aren‚Äôt toxic to dogs which attract small birds (which eat wasps). 

My neighbour told me that you should trim the stems to stimulate growth which I have now realised was incorrect. It apparently stunts the growth. Also, I‚Äôve literally only started watering them properly as I thought they were the plant version of a camel. There has been some growth since the more frequent watering. I also was putting that eco-oil on the bamboo to deter pests. 

The point I‚Äôm getting at, is it now almost impossible to birth these things back to health or should I rip them out and start again? The soil in my area sucks too, it‚Äôs half clay. I‚Äôve just had this sudden realisation that there‚Äôs a large purple elephant in my backyard that I haven‚Äôt even noticed.

175q6sw,1697061512.0,New bed,Neighbor allowed me to garden an old unused 10x16 plot. Everything did mediocre this year in there but his soil is dirt and so I went with it. The sweet corn and tomatoes I harvested and cut plants at soil level and kept roots in ground as I always do. After harvesting pumpkins I noticed two things: one is that I had 3 varieties that all looked the exact same shade of dull orange. 15 feet away I have another garden bed of my own with a single vine of the same variety as one of the 3 in my neighbors bed. This vine is much healthier and the fruits are more vibrantly orange. This was my first clue. Then I pulled one of the squash plants out of the ground and saw the roots looked unhealthy. The vine with the vibrant squash 15 feet away still has one more that I‚Äôm letting to so I haven‚Äôt been able to inspect the roots yet. What is the cause of these roots and inability to fully express their genetic potential ie color and possibly flavor and overall plant health. Could it be a pathogen? Pests like a nematode etc?

Background: I bought a house in LA six years ago and the house came with a few rows of drought resistant landscaping out front‚Äî rosemary, succulents, a fruiting loquat tree, Bougainville‚Äî and I kept on the house‚Äôs once a month gardener who speaks no English. (I speak very little Spanish.) Six years ago I bought a passionfruit plant at a farmers market and planted at the front row of my garden, followed the care instructions (which I‚Äôve since forgotten) for a while and gave up over time when it seemed to be dying and wasn‚Äôt producing any fruit. 

A few years ago I noticed the plant had survived, grown sideways, and seemed to be over growing/strangling a flowering thorny bush at the corner of my garden fence. Still no fruit, and I assumed there never would be.

Fast forward to yesterday when my new next door neighbor informs me they are soon going to be aggressively trimming the bush as it is growing over the corner of my fence onto their property. I said of course, but that‚Äôs when noticed the invading passionfruit vines were finally fruiting! Somewhere between ten and fifteen green passionfruits, most on my side or the street side of the fence, about a third growing onto my neighbor‚Äôs side.

I‚Äôm delighted by this surprise. Not sure ‚Äúwhy now‚Äù except perhaps the unusually rainy year gave the plant what it needed to produce. 

I would like to save the plant and start actually tending to it so it can produce for years to come, but as you can see from the photos it‚Äôs all mixed up and entangled with the corner plant and I don‚Äôt know the first thing about how to separate them or care for them beyond what my gardener does on a monthly basis. I don‚Äôt even know the name of the plant it has overtaken, or when best to pluck the fruit‚Ä¶ is it green passionfruit or do I need to wait until it darkens? It feels moderately ‚Äúfull‚Äù to the touch but I have no idea how full they are‚Ä¶ or if they‚Äôve been sufficiently watered to be juicy/edible. I also intend to let my neighbor trim what they need to, but wonder if there is any kind of collaboration/intervention I could arrange to steer the plant back my way‚Ä¶ though I understand my gardening failures may mean it‚Äôs too late.

Again, I apologize for the infodump. I appreciate any feedback, insights, guesses, or advice! Thank you.",3,2,1.0,0

They looked very sad, had droopy leaves, didn't gain any height (less than an inch out of the cococoir) but small inklings of true leave spikes were starting, albeit very slowly. 

To my great surprise, when I transplanted all the seedlings (including the ""control group"") the small, sad looking seedlings had AMAZING roots! Like many LONG parallel roots, with TONS of perpendicular tendrils....total root mass was easily comparable to the seedlings which had multiple true leaves out, and several inches tall.

Seems like since the plant wasn't getting much nutrients without mycelial symbiosis, so all the growth energy was going into root systems, searching for nutrients.

I'm attempting to identify plants in my yard to eradicate early before they become worse pests. I live on a mostly un-landscaped acre (I rent) in the SoCal desert on a sand lot. It's still nearly 90 here, and everything is still growing. I'm still yanking ragweed, which is literally five feet tall in my neighbors' yards. One of my dogs is allergic. Gah.

After the heavy rains of this past winter and spring, I have a lot of what looks like puncturevine that hasn't spread into those long whips. I did pull the obvious puncturevine plants, as those burrs are NASTY and constantly get in my dogs' paws and in the soles of my shoes. But I have some other plants that look just like puncturevine leaves but never grow longer -- they look almost like tiny fern-y ground cover.

At first I thought they were a different sex of the puncturevine, but then I read puncturevine is hermaphroditic.  Is it possibly another less invasive/harmful caltrop species? If they flowered, it was early in the spring before they were so abundant, so that doesn't help. I've searched and searched online and can't find the information I need.

I don't want to bother hoeing it out if it's harmless. I pretty much leave everything native in the yard for the birds and the bees if it's not hurting me or the pets.

179f9p6,1697486720.0,Pineapples! A how-to guide to grow & care for your own :),"About 25 years ago I moved from New England, which is full of seasons, to a little peninsula in South Florida with a very tropical year-round climate‚Ä¶ which is where I discovered my love for Bromeliads and have been growing them ever since!

Pineapples are a variety of Bromeliad, I have been growing generational pineapples for many years. And while they do prefer to grow in a climate like mine, they can be grown in all other zones, as long as their needs are met, which are quite simple really. 
____
Pineapple plants are very resilient and they have simple needs: warm weather, sunshine, water, quick draining soil, & time (lots & lots of time). 

- The preferred growing zone is 11-12. 

- As far as temperature; they fruit optimally between 68-86¬∞F, anything below 60 or above 90 will still suffice, it just slows down the growth rate.

An easy solution is to grow them in pots! I do this even here so they can be easily moved around during the seasons to get shade during high-heat. If you do have frost where you are, they can grow outside in the summer and inside in the winter (just put them in your sunniest window). They have a pretty shallow root system, so the pot size can be pretty small compared to the adult plant size. 

I generally like to use the fabric grow bags for pots, because of their lightweight & great draining. 

- For water; since they are a Bromeliad, they have a built-in water tank! Which is located in the central part of the plant stem that is created by the leaves shaping into a hollow cylinder. They need to keep this constantly full of water (and is how they collect and store rain and dew naturally).  

Once the ground roots are established in soil, they do not need much water at all, overfilling the plants water tank when it‚Äôs low to allow a decent trickling into the soil is sufficient. 

- For soil; they prefer fast draining and to not have their ground roots soaking in water.

I like to use Miracle Grows ‚ÄúCactus, Palm & Citrus Potting Mix‚Äù in the orange bag. However, there are bromeliad specific soils that can be used. And make sure your pot has enough drainage holes.

- For time; this will vary significantly based on all the factors listed above and how the plant is started. Even in ideal growing conditions the time is extensive, I will list the times based on my climate (which is ideal for pineapples)

For growing from a topper; it will take 24-36 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop.

For growing from a pup or slip; it will take 12-18 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop. 

*this is why generational pineapple plants are the preferred growing method*
____
Other things to know about pineapples:

- They will not survive 28¬∞F or lower, this will destroy the entire plant and all parts. 

- The parent plant will only produce one pineapple fruit and then die. 

- The parent plant will produce pups & slips. 

- Not all pineapple plant varieties produce slips, but all will produce at least 1 pup. 

- Most parent plants will produce more pups once the previous pups have been removed. 
___
Pineapple parent plants will produce up to 4 ways to propagate future pineapple plants. 

- Toppers are the crown of the fruit itself

- Slips grow from the top of peduncle stem and base of the fruit

- Aerial pups grow from aerial roots located in between the leaves 

- Ground pups grow from the main root stem under the soil or at the very base of the plant
____
Toppers are a great way to start on your pineapple plant journey!

- Pick a fruit with vibrant green leaves to start with, the healthier your starting point = the healthier your plant

- Remove the topper from the fruit, I like to leave about 1/2 inch of the actual fruit part to use the core as part of the main stem for stability reasons

- Clean off any excess fruit with a paring knife; I like to score the fruit from the bottom first

- Clean off lower layers of leaves to expose root nodes by gently grabbing each leaf and peeling from side to side (you‚Äôll notice leaves at the base of the topper are much smaller than the ones at the top: remove all those small leaves)

Slips, if your plant produces them, should be removed pretty quickly from the fruit base, since it directly drains energy from fruit development. If you plan to propagate with them, allow them to grow at least 2‚Äù in size first. (I just quickly dispose of these when they start to happen)

- The fruit base will have its own independent leaves, so make sure to properly identify a slip, which would look like a small topper growing out

- Firmly grab and twist off while supporting the fruit and stem to prevent damage

Aerial pups are the easiest and best to use for propagating, they do not feed off of the parent plant (they will drink out of the tank water supply) and come off very easily. 

- When they are about 4-6‚Äù in size, firmly grab them and twist them right off. 

Ground pups are also very common to develop, but can be hard to see at first since they might be buried and not as easy to remove. 

- You can try to twist them off once they‚Äôre about 5-8‚Äù in size

- You can cut them off of the main root

- You can just leave them alone and once the parent plant dies off, they will take over the pot. (this is not as aesthetically pleasing)

- You can wait until the parent plant dies off, then just pull them apart and repot them directly into soil

To root all of the above future plants: the easiest way is to simply put them in a glass vessel full of water and place in a windowsill!

- Make sure the mouth of the container is smaller than the leaves, the plant will hold itself up

- Keep the water supply up to the bottom of the leaves where the root nodes live

- Remove it every few days to rinse the roots off, rinse the vessel out, and refill with fresh water to keep it healthy

- Once roots develop, plant growth is noticed, and a decent cylindrical hole is in the center of the leaves.. it can be transplanted to soil. 

- If you would like to stall their growth cycle, just continue to keep them happy & healthy in the water. I do this for a couple of reasons; to have multiple parent plants fruiting at different times and to have a back-up saved for emergencies, the longest I have stalled a pup is 18 months! (that one is the one in my photos, it‚Äôs entire family was destroyed in hurricane Ian)

- Once potted, water both the leaf tank and the soil frequently until a growth spurt happens, then you can just overfill the leaf tank. (that means the plant established itself and transfer to soil was successful)
____
I am including some photos to help give a visual for you to refer to!

- I drew & labeled parts of the parent plant for you 

- I have included photos of other bromeliads with examples of both aerial & ground pups

- There is a current pineapple plant growing with an extra photo of spikes developing on the sides of the leaves, not all varieties have them (these will tear you up! They will grow to be razor sharp! I use elbow high leather gloves to care for my pineapple plants)

- Photos of me using a very crappy store bought pineapple (it‚Äôs all they had, I‚Äôm so sorry!) as an example step by step for turning your own fruit into a plant. 

Please pick a nicer & healthier looking pineapple topper to use!!

You will notice the core in the fruit & me scoring that, removing all the fruit bits, peeling the leaves off, and the small little bumps & wiggles that are aerial root nodes (those are the parts you want to submerge in the water!)
____
Make sure that your pineapple fruit or plant is an edible variety (like from a fruit in the grocery store produce) and not an ornamental variety, if you plant to eat them. But, if you just want to grow them for looks, taking care of an ornamental or dwarf plant is the same, just on a smaller scale.

178nfms,1697399456.0,Looking for plants and flowers safe for my indoor cats.,"(Our cats are indoor only, to be precise)

We weren't sure whether to ask this on a local Montreal subreddit for the few people that might know flowers and plants or to come to a gardening subreddit that might know different regions but asking here makes more sense.

This was never an issue until our recently adopted senior boy went for our Virginia Creeper and English Ivy, lavender and other plants. Our previous cat didn't care for them at all, so ok, now we have a cat that goes for toxic plants.

So the question is, knowing that we are in Montreal (hardiness zone 5b) and that we happen to get very little direct light on our balcony or through our windows but a very good amount of non direct daylight all day because of our exposure, what flowers, plants, small trees and bushes can we have that won't kill our cats? Aesthetically, we had been going for a very traditional English garden look with our overall balcony and indoor gardening but not harming our cats is obviously a greater priority than aesthetics.

Hi there-
This summer I got two potted Bougainviellas that were doing great on my balcony until I went on vacation for 2 1/2 weeks.

After I came back, I pruned back everything to where I was seeing green in the cuts (i thought it was a good sign it's still alive in there?). But now it's October and the plants don't seem to be sprouting any more new green leaves, except for 2-3 on the one plant, and I'm worried that they're just going to die now. Plus they were ""winter hardened""

177gsjw,1697255607.0,Starting Seeds During Autumn Indoors.,"Sooo this is my first year gardening and I've gotten really into growing plants from seed. I've done this completely indoors since I started gardening in April in zone 8b (Seattle area). I was afraid of starting them outdoors and it getting too hot when they're too young, so I've moved them outside throughout the summer as they've gotten big enough. I have some seedlings that I started in the middle of September that will obviously wait to go outside until after any danger of frost, with it being October. I plan to start seeds throughout fall and winter but I was curious of people's personal experiences with growing plants from seeds during this time of year. 

I guess my main question is, do seeds ""know"" it's winter, despite growlights, consitent temperature, etc? Maybe it's just a few plants in particular, but I've noticed them growing slower this last week, and my main concern is obviously the plants getting too big before winter is over. 

What are your guys' experiences with growing seeds in the winter indoors? I'm not talking about vegetables and herbs, as I stick to ornamental plants mainly. Examples of seedlings I have now are Celosia, Amaranth, Snapdragon, Scabiosa, and Lupine to name a few.

Oh and a general question, when do people start watering seedlings like they are adults?",1,1,1.0,0

Planted these Hydrangeas today. The closest one was the first planting, I decided to move the second farther away since leaves were larger. Currently wondering if the first is too close to the structure and whether it would be better to move tomorrow (would be about 18 hours after planting) or let it ride to avoid additional shock.

Any thoughts are appreciated. I am also very open to advice on preparation. I amended the top 12‚Äù or so of the soil across the row (2-3 ft width) with mushroom compost and organic outdoor planting soil before digging the holes (deeper than 12‚Äù), filling with additional outdoor planting soil, fertilizing, and mulching.

I‚Äôm considering taking the soil between the plants (5 ft spacing currently) to shovel depth and amending the same way to allow for sideways growth, is this warranted or overkill?

So my partner and I have been ramping up our garden and plan to add 4 more 4ft x 8ft 12"" deep raised beds next year. Our current 2 I placed on lawn soil that I turned over before filling with new compost soil, and they worked out decently  though we had a lot of rain and I think there was too much organic matter to drain well in the early months.
For the new ones where we want to place them is somewhat unique. My property had an above ground pool when I moved in that I removed immediately. Underneath is a base layer of sand (possibly on top of gravel also possibly with a plastic liner) approx 25ft diameter. This is hands down the sunniest spot of our yard, so it is where we plan to put the new beds. The sand is fairly hard packed, but drains pretty well as you would imagine sand would, it is at least 18-24 inches of sand and might have gravel beneath but I actually didn't dig any up when I dug in for the depth check, so it might just be 2 ft of sand on native soil. Native soil is fairly sandy as we are in a river delta. My goal for the beds is a sandy loam to grow mostly cucurbits in, and it will be drip irrigated for when rain isn't sufficient. I dont think there is a hard pan going on.
So specifically, short of digging up and replacing 128-256 cubic feet of sand by hand, what can I do to be sure these new beds drain properly? 
I figure in the least I will break up the sand some down to 12-18"" so it isn't as hard packed. I also considered driving small 1"" x 4ft softwood stakes through the sand that sit somewhat flush with the bottom of the raised bed every 2sqft. My thought here is that it will guarantee a hole through to subsoil for water to drain in case there is a plastic liner or gravel, and over time will decompose but remain a drainage channel.

If the original underwatering was still taking her toll, why did she go through a green growth phase? Why did she turn yellow and brown only a week after receiving water?

I learned thyme is drought tolerant and to err on less water. I was afraid somehow the soil was retaining too much moisture (even though it had that soil for a year w/o problems), so I didn‚Äôt water it again for two weeks. 

Factors: There is a chance I put her outside and the water evaporated, but I am uncertain if I did this. I also put her under a grow light for that week. She also had mold caked onto the soil that I removed.  

What can I do to give her hope? 

I‚Äôve pruned her a bit already, and it‚Äôs been 4 days since she‚Äôs been barren. How can I prune her more to make for the highest chance of survival and new growth?

175utnc,1697074299.0,Seed-eating animal,"Just started replanting my small garden (amateur flower lover), going good so far, but one particular area keeps on getting bombarded with some flower-seed loving animal. I've even added netting over the entire bed then replanted/seeded, which has seemed to work in the past, but these holes have popped up again and I think I need to replant there. 

Any thoughts on what the animal might be (just out of curiousity), or solutions?

My hypothesis is that crows are getting to it, despite the netting (the netting is not very tight, will pretty easily bend to touch the soil if i apply enough weight, which is what I will attempt next if no one has any other suggestions)

Would be interesting if there are some weird soil watering physics or underground animal that could be the cause of this?

Almost always, the remaining branches/sections of the affected bush are still doing well enough that they're growing new growth. Many of the leaves both summers developed a bit of a dull/mottled appearance, but I've never seen more obvious signs of mites or any other pests. They've been watered well and consistently. However, overwatering/root rot seems unlikely given the heat and dryness this summer and the fact that grey, soggy winter did not see real progression of the problem or additional sections dying off.

1792bx2,1697449952.0,Grow light recommendations for money-plant on 5ft high trellis in a shaded window,"**Context:** My money plant is not growing too well on this trellis. The leaves are yellowing and falling-off two often and the growth is very slow (compared to other money plants which are lying in a balcony which receives good sunlight)

**About the trellis:** The trellis in question is 5 feet high and is installed outside a window which doesn't get much sunlight (mostly reflected sunlight). The picture taken below is at 3pm -- at this time the sun is shining really bright and it's uncomfortable standing out in the open for too long, but this trellis isn't getting much sunlight.

**Question:** The FAQ/wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/wiki/faq/lighting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/wiki/faq/lighting/) recommends having the grow light **2 inches** away from the plant? **Is this applicable to my case as well?** What kind of grow lights would you recommend for my situation?

I‚Äôm new here and hopefully this is the right place to ask! Basically my wife and I decided to clean out our flower beds to start fresh!

Our plan is to have azaleas be the main component but are having trouble finding the right perennial and ground cover plants to complement! This has been very confusing and frustrating for us as we‚Äôve never had much of a green thumb or and eye for landscape design lol

We have a yellow colored home and decided that we want a calm color scheme. Blues, purples, whites and maybe a splash of pink here and there. We are choosing multiple dwarf variants to our azaleas and plan on adding a few foxtail turns, 3 frost proof gardenias to the edges of our beds along with three dwarf black diamonds crepe myrtles! 

We would like our ground cover plants to be small maybe 3‚Äù-5‚Äù tall and maybe about the same in width , we are in love with a creeping phlox but have come to understand they are very invasive and don‚Äôt grow to well in our area (Louisiana zone 8a).

It is funny though. The squirrels are helping as much as they can. At the same time they are in the tree  munching away and throwing the debris on our heads as we are trying to clean up the mess and do yard work..

1794igq,1697458276.0,BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE," 

The frequency of adding humus and compost to your vegetable garden is determined by various factors. Generally, a recommended practice is to introduce compost once a year, either in the spring or fall. 

[BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE: A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO RECYCLE](https://lovjoyfulgarden.com/bucket-composting-at-home-small-space-a-sustainable-way-to-recycle/)

1. For vegetables that will be consumed raw, it's recommended to apply composted manure at least 60 days prior to harvest. Ideally, apply the manure in the fall to give ample time for the decomposition of any potential pathogens before planting your garden in the spring. This approach ensures the safety of your fresh produce for uncooked consumption.

2. Refrain from using cat, dog, or pig manures in your gardens or compost piles, as these may harbor parasites that can endure and pose health risks to humans.

3. Avoid applying manure once your garden is already planted.

Prior to consumption, ensure thorough washing of uncooked vegetables.

4. Individuals at heightened risk of foodborne illnesses, including pregnant women, young children, and those with underlying health conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes, or AIDS, should steer clear of consuming raw vegetables from gardens fertilized with manure.

This replenishes nutrients and enhances soil structure. For humus, consider adding it every 2-3 years to maintain organic matter content. However, the specific needs of your garden can vary, so it's advisable to perform soil tests to determine nutrient levels and adjust your application schedule accordingly. Balancing the soil's organic matter is essential for healthy and productive vegetable growth.",0,0,0.25,0

(Pics show degression),"Hello Earthly Caretakers, my thyme plant was under watered (going 2-4 weeks without water). I watered her, and she began to turn green and flourish as in the first pic.   

But then by the end of the week all her leaves turned yellow and brown, crinkly tipped. I was perplexed on why she was dying after going through a growth phase, and I became afraid of giving her more water. Was it still the original underwatering taking a toll? 

The 1st picture was two weeks ago when she had a drink. The 2nd picture is just this last Saturday, when she began to turn yellow and brown-tipped. She still had green, but she turned brown in the 3rd picture by Wednesday. And the 4th picture is her before pruning: very barren. The last pic is after pruning, today. 

How can I prune her to give her the best chance at regrowth? Two people have said to prune all of her branches off to give her a chance to refresh, but I‚Äôm afraid to do this. It‚Äôs hard to see in the picture, but there are tiny green buds (smaller than a gnat) on some of the branches. Should I still prune her entirely, or leave these for photosynthesis?

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

Fast forward to today, I noticed the leaf spot disease wasn't fully healed, and the leaves(?) on the ripening persimmons had spots. I also noticed a couple of mealybugs near the stem of the fruitüò≠ I treated the tree again with neem oil last night but the damage is already done

Would these persimmons be safe to eat? I
sprayed 70% alcohol on the stem area where I saw a mealybug and drenched the fruits in dawn dish soap + water.

Are these persimmons safe to eat?,"l've have a persimmon tree in my backyard for years, but it never kept the fruit on the tree long enough to ripen (it would fall early and/or get eaten by something). For the first time in years, we've had success in having the fruits ripen enough on the tree!

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

Fast forward to today, I noticed the leaf spot disease wasn't fully healed, and the leaves(?) on the ripening persimmons had spots. I also noticed a couple of mealybugs near the stem of the fruitüò≠ I treated the tree again with neem oil last night but the damage is already done

Would these persimmons be safe to eat? I
sprayed 70% alcohol on the stem area where I saw a mealybug and drenched the fruits in dawn dish soap + water.

TLDR; Suspected leaf spot disease and
mealybug infestation on my persimmon tree. The persimmons are looking a little suspicious, Are these safe to eat with my family?",19,0,0.33,0

I currently live in condo with only a front patio to garden with so everything has to be container friendly unfortunately.

Are there any edible plants that no one would guess that can be grown in flowerbed containers or larger grow bags??

For example, I thought no way you could be able to grow pumpkins in a container and I just recently found out you can grow ones that have been modified for container gardens!!

I would love to hear more recs from seasoned gardeners who would say what other plants beginners would never guess that can be grown in patio containers and which ones are worth growing in such limited space.

Thanks!! May you all have a lovely day üòä

I grow a lot of herbs, and use mint as a ground cover (no till garden). A stray tater found its way over there, and I just shoved it in the ground and left it. 

It grew well all season pretending it was one of the herbs or flowers. The ground cover makes it so I don't have to water much at all. It was still green but starting to sag last week, so I dug it up.

There was one normal sized potato, and THIS. The biggest damn potato I've ever seen. It might have grown more but there was a fingerling potato plant right next to it, which I think is what I had actually planted. The russet was just hiding out. I thought I was pulling up a big rock.",1,11,0.8,0

I have absolutely no experience with amaryllis. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do with these? (as in like do I plant them in individual pots? Do I do something before I plant them? Again, no experience whatsoever with this) Their roots were incredibly tangled so I had to cut and rip.

Back Row - Holy Basil (Green & Purple: Ram and Krishna)

Front Row - Left Side - Marigold

Front Row - Right Side - Holy Basil and Cilantro

Seedling Case - Marigold Seedlings (50-70x)

Black Pot - More Holy Basil

The reason for having so many Basil plants, is that I want to have enough to produce thousands of tulsi seeds because I need it every year. But! It‚Äôs also super invasive because it‚Äôs seeds always fall off and fly away. So I transplanted the invasive seedlings into the black temporary pot. The Marigolds are the quickest to germinate in my stock right, with less than roughly 2 days for it to start.

Cilantro are also my fast germinators, but only if wettened.

Also getting into strawberry. I ordered 4 strawberry plants, which came as 8, but dormant and are starting to shine again.

Small pots on the bottom are just transplanted marigolds and trial at having more cilantro.

I live on the east coast, so the winter will slow down a whole a lot. I have a lot of lights to give it full sunlight, but I am worried about draft air making rooms super cold. So hopefully by December, all of these plants start doing what plants do.",2,11,0.81,0

Are these persimmons safe to eat?,"l've have a persimmon tree in my backyard for years, but it never kept the fruit on the tree long enough to ripen (it would fall early and/or get eaten by something). For the first time in years, we've had success in having the fruits ripen enough on the tree!

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

Fast forward to today, I noticed the leaf spot disease wasn't fully healed, and the leaves(?) on the ripening persimmons had spots. I also noticed a couple of mealybugs near the stem of the fruitüò≠ I treated the tree again with neem oil last night but the damage is already done

Would these persimmons be safe to eat? I
sprayed 70% alcohol on the stem area where I saw a mealybug and drenched the fruits in dawn dish soap + water.

TLDR; Suspected leaf spot disease and
mealybug infestation on my persimmon tree. The persimmons are looking a little suspicious, Are these safe to eat with my family?",19,0,0.36,0

First year gardening, and outside of the abject failure of our carrots and onions, everything else was fair to call a success. Particularly, as you can see, the tomatoes. And as much as we love tomatoes, we're definitely going to need to find some folks to offload some of these.

The varieties we grew were Italian Roma, Roma VF, San Marzano, and Beefsteak. Both Roma varieties were the most vigorous and provided the most consistent harvest. San Marzano were pretty good. Beefsteak proved the most difficult, being prone to splitting and slow to grow and rippen.

We additionally grew green beans of the Harvester Bush variety, which were awesome and produced like mad...until the grasshoppers came. I have made mortal enemies of these creatures.

And, most interestingly, we had a volunteer pumpkin plant! You can look back in my post history where I sought an ID for a mystery plant that appeared in spring.

I have absolutely no experience with amaryllis. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do with these? (as in like do I plant them in individual pots? Do I do something before I plant them? Again, no experience whatsoever with this) Their roots were incredibly tangled so I had to cut and rip.

1. I now have 100 plants instead of 30 plants (the number will only grow)
2. Started herb garden (mint, tusli, lemongrass, curry leaves, chives)
3. Have planted 3 pots of spring onions, they grow so fast! (I use these a lot, so it's good to have hoke grown)
4. My last rubber plant died, so  I got a new one last month. I have been taking really good care of it, after lots of research, the baby is thriving.
5. I learned how to make home made neem water as organic pesticides, and it's working so well.
6. I found earthworms in a nursery, so got some to add to outdoor soil. I added a layer of mulch to it, food for the worms. Hopefully after 90 days I shall have my very own vermi compost
7. I planted 6 asiatic lilies, the bulbs grew into tall plants within 19 days, waiting for them to blossom. 
8. I have 4 huge aloe plants that I plan on using for skincare and haircare.

Frankly I'm addicted to gardening now. It's so therapeutic. Nurturing the plants, watching them thrive, I feel sense of pride. 
The daily 30 minutes target sometimes turns to 2 hours on weekends. I love the mindfulness the practice of gardening brings. Going back to  roots rather than binge watching Netflix/Prime.
