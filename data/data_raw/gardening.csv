It has been a rough year with regard to weather.  Early spring freeze killed lots of crops.  Tons and tons of rain and high wind events.  Many overcast and/or cool days.  Tons of smoke from Quebec at times.  Due to our weather and high elevation, the plants aren‚Äôt as far along as others in 5B/5A.

Harvested some tomatoes and corn yesterday in advance of impending rainy days.  

A little over 30 tomato plants consisting of:

*Brandywine
*Cherokee Purple
*Black Krim (Slava Ukraine!)
*Sungold 
*Indigo Ruby
*Yellow Pear
*Green Zebra
*San Marzano
*Hillbilly
*Big Boy

1681a3y,1693657771.0,[FINAL UPDATE] Raised planting bed for the Mrs.,"#IT'S FINISHED!!

The Mrs. and I spent all afternoon Monday and Tuesday prepping the bed for the soil delivery on Wednesday. 

This week may have been the hardest *physically* for us, but it had the least impressive results...

...until the very end. 

I think the photos speak for themselves. This thing (I've avoided doing for years) looks amazing! I want to garden in it myself!

What we accomplished this week:

    1) Lined the bottom of the bed with huge maple logs, then smaller logs and then large Western bark chunks spread on top
    
    2) Fixed my busted wheelbarrow. Lol
    
    3) Added pulleys to the tensioning wire for smoother operation. 

    4) Transferred 6 yards of 50/50 soil/compost mix into the bed. 

    5) Planted all the orphan plants (mostly lettuce) that never found a home this year. 

    6) Collapsed from exhaustion.

I'm going to be serious for a moment here. 

 During c0vid, the wife and I started drinking more. Like, a *lot* more. It was starting to affect our marriage and our relationship with our children. 

120 days ago we decided to stop drinking entirely. Since then we have been more active, more communicative and more present in our children's lives. 

This project was the culmination of our efforts to show each other our dedication to our relationship and also to our son and daughter.  

#I would like to thank this community for their eagerness to impart knowledge. Your insights and experiences have helped us avoid the early pitfalls of raised bed gardening. 

    I would also like to thank my wife for being compassionate and loving for the last 19 years. I am proud of the foundation we have created to raise our family together.

They are a health hazard.","[https://gardening.ces.ncsu.edu/2019/02/there-are-better-options-than-using-tires-in-the-garden/](https://gardening.ces.ncsu.edu/2019/02/there-are-better-options-than-using-tires-in-the-garden/)

Old tires leach petrochemicals, rubber compounds and all kinds of heavy metals (including mercury and lead) into surrounding soil and groundwater. A tire, even partially, submerged in water will kill most aquatic life within weeks. Plants will absorb these pollutants, so eating anything grown next to an old tire is literal poison. Don't even use the plants for composting for the same reason. 

Just like re-using old yoghurt/butter/milk/... plastic pots will leach BPA and micro-plastics after a year of exposure to water, oxygen and especially sunlight. Re-using/saving money is great. But keep in mind there is more to consider than saving money or waste. 

I know this won't lead (hehe, get it) to people hastily removing the tires, some people might even think it's not that big of a deal, but for anyone who is still debating whether to use them or not: **DO NOT.**",367,3001,0.96,gardening

Here's what I did:

    1) Painted and installed wooden decorative corner embellishments

    2) Put up a chicken wire sub wall to create a vapor space

    3) Put up a rubber bladder moisture barrier wall (I used an old portable spill containment for the material)

    4) Installed solar LED night lighting

The only thing left now is to put down a flagstone pathway in the interior section. I'm planning on going to the patio store today to pick out the stones and get the other materials. 

#Thanks again to this community for being so helpful and suggesting great ideas!

I'm trying to subsidize my grocery costs by growing a ton of tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, beans, corn, squash, cucumbers..... the vast majority of which I'm planning on preserving for my personal use.

Now that the garden is well underway, I've gotten lots of random people, (many of whom are people I've never met), inquiring about getting some of my veggies like my little plot is a ""pick your own"" free farm. One of my neighbours, who I only know in passing, wants to bring his kids over to have a garden harvest experience!

How do you guys deal with these walk-up moochers? 

Do you explain that your garden equates to a part-time job of back breaking, sun burning, dirty, sweaty labour? And putting in a garden is certainly not free as fertilizer, soil additives like manure, fencing, seeds, trellising, water.... all cost money!

Don't get me wrong. I will share SOME with my close friends, but It's not a community freebie!... especially since it eats up virtually all my weekends and on top of that I started some of my veg (celery) in February!",717,1827,0.98,gardening

We have a fence up, I hung white strips of plastic, I've put clumps of Irish spring soap everywhere. They have eaten every. single. plant. Only thing they haven't destroyed was my tomatoes. The beans and peas are gone down to the stems. They eat just enough of the cucumber and peppers to keep them from growing enough to produce anything.  Then they make sure I know it was them by taking a giant shit dead middle of the garden. 

Edit: some of you don't know what a community garden is and it really shows. I appreciate all the advice though.

Edit 2: I feel it's important to point out there are several other garden plots that are not fenced at all and the deer don't go there at all. That's why I'm convinced it's personal.",607,1808,0.98,gardening

I live in a townhouse for many years. 
 
No one ever had problem with my plants in yard.
 
I take good care of them and I have help doing so too everyday. 
 
I even cut my own lawn once or twice a week. 
 
Lawn cutting crew even said they have on their list from the office not to cut my lawn or do yard work.
 
Yet today, my landlord came over and said the lawn crew is constantly complaining to him because they don't know how to cut my lawn -
 
- (total lie, first because I'm on the no cut list, second because the lawn crew always stops by and compliments my garden once a week during their cuts and never says any problem). 
 
There is a tree about 20 meters away that I complained about twice this year that has a massive infestation of those red stink bugs. 
 
Nothing was done. 
 
A few of them migrated over to my yard and on the fence and I've spent money with successful traps and sprays that are working, but even a dummy know that they'll keep coming back until that tree infestation is delt with (puddles of these bugs surround the trunk, ground around it, and branches). 
 
The landlord is trying to say now that I am the reason the bugs have spread to the neighbors yards due to my garden, NOT the unattended infested tree they're coming from.
 
 Oh, and one of the neighbours is screaming about mice in her house when she leaves her front door wide open 18 hours a day. 
 
Landlord says she should be able to do that in the SUMMER and FALL as mice are only around the outside of houses in the winter. 
 
So he says now that that neighbour is saying the mice are coming from my garden into her house and the landlord is legit taking her side. 
 
Oh, and if I don't cut down my garden to NOTHING in 2 days, I face possibility of EVICTION apparently. Oh, and he just upped my rent to almost 1900$. 
 
No, moving in Calgary is not an option right now, it's literally more expensive if I leave this place this year, it's terrible here for pricing. 
 
Please help me to stop panicking. I need this garden for my mental health, I have been relying on it and coping through shitty life with positive gardening, I can't just cut I down. 
 
I even told my landlord that just right now. 
 
Know what he said?
 
He said he understands how important mental health is and understands that everyone can get mental illness- but still remove your garden now!!! 
 
I feel like I'm going to be one of those tree hugger protesters in 2 days from now strapping myself to my sunflowers and my dog to the tomato plants and my cats to the (vertical, not even horizontal!!) Zucchini plants in protest. I'm not even kidding. I have a physical disability and it's so so hard that I even was able to grow this garden this year, I cannot just up an move either due to it. 
 
I'm not asking for a solution.

I started gardening for the first time this year. I have raised beds in full sun with a mix of topsoil, mushroom compost, and composted manure. I'm in zone 7a.

I transplanted seedlings early in the season, but nearly universally my seedlings were very slow to grow, grew at very inconsistent rates, and haven't produced until very late in the season. My eggplants, cabbages, and peppers all only started producing a week or two ago. My tomatoes and squash and zucchini are only now beginning to produce. The cucumbers never really produced at all.

I started most seeds inside, transplanted them in the spring when the various packages indicated it.

For a long long time, it just seemed like my plants were staying tiny. I didn't fertilize until late in the season because I was under the impression that the compost and everything in the soil would be sufficient.

I have a feeling I overwatered the garden pretty much the whole summer now that I've seen my water bill (hundreds of dollars increase per month). It was on a daily automatic waterer.

Aside from overwatering, what other mistakes might I have made that could have caused this? Does this sound typical of too much water and insufficient nutrients?",304,1535,0.99,gardening

There are a couple more growing that look just like this one. The first few off this plant were normal but as we go along they are getting weirder and weirder. I wonder if something happened systemically.

Outta pure rage I started to clean up the overgrown jungle this garden was. It was at a decent point but I needed to plant! So I took seeds that I had for about 4 years. Planted two rows of cucumbers, 3 rows of different peas, 6 tiny rows of carrots, a row of broccoli, a row of butter lettuce, a row of yellow beans, a long row of mammoth sunflowers! I did end up planting 16 corns plants late which I never expected to see anything on! I didn‚Äôt do anything special to the soil, I flipped it and tried to get as much of the grass roots out. As everything started to slowly sprout, I was full of so much joy! I never expected these seeds that were ‚Äúexpired‚Äù to grow. The first harvest of everything was the most joyful and genuinely happy I have been in years! It took me right back to my nana‚Äôs back yard. So I started pickling and sharing the wealth with my family and friends. The joy of watching all my love ones enjoying my hard work and dedication! Was the best reward from this! But to be completely honest it was the sunflowers that brought me the most joy! The bloom right in time for my birthday! They were 9ft tall! I I have two plant them twice and I didn‚Äôt get many of them, but the few I got made the end of the garden season to a beautiful joyous moment!

I live in a townhouse for many years. 
 
No one ever had problem with my plants in yard.
 
I take good care of them and I have help doing so too everyday. 
 
I even cut my own lawn once or twice a week. 
 
Lawn cutting crew even said they have on their list from the office not to cut my lawn or do yard work.
 
Yet today, my landlord came over and said the lawn crew is constantly complaining to him because they don't know how to cut my lawn -
 
- (total lie, first because I'm on the no cut list, second because the lawn crew always stops by and compliments my garden once a week during their cuts and never says any problem). 
 
There is a tree about 20 meters away that I complained about twice this year that has a massive infestation of those red stink bugs. 
 
Nothing was done. 
 
A few of them migrated over to my yard and on the fence and I've spent money with successful traps and sprays that are working, but even a dummy know that they'll keep coming back until that tree infestation is delt with (puddles of these bugs surround the trunk, ground around it, and branches). 
 
The landlord is trying to say now that I am the reason the bugs have spread to the neighbors yards due to my garden, NOT the unattended infested tree they're coming from.
 
 Oh, and one of the neighbours is screaming about mice in her house when she leaves her front door wide open 18 hours a day. 
 
Landlord says she should be able to do that in the SUMMER and FALL as mice are only around the outside of houses in the winter. 
 
So he says now that that neighbour is saying the mice are coming from my garden into her house and the landlord is legit taking her side. 
 
Oh, and if I don't cut down my garden to NOTHING in 2 days, I face possibility of EVICTION apparently. Oh, and he just upped my rent to almost 1900$. 
 
No, moving in Calgary is not an option right now, it's literally more expensive if I leave this place this year, it's terrible here for pricing. 
 
Please help me to stop panicking. I need this garden for my mental health, I have been relying on it and coping through shitty life with positive gardening, I can't just cut I down. 
 
I even told my landlord that just right now. 
 
Know what he said?
 
He said he understands how important mental health is and understands that everyone can get mental illness- but still remove your garden now!!! 
 
I feel like I'm going to be one of those tree hugger protesters in 2 days from now strapping myself to my sunflowers and my dog to the tomato plants and my cats to the (vertical, not even horizontal!!) Zucchini plants in protest. I'm not even kidding. I have a physical disability and it's so so hard that I even was able to grow this garden this year, I cannot just up an move either due to it. 
 
I'm not asking for a solution.

Planted two rows of cucumbers, 3 rows of different peas, 6 tiny rows of carrots, a row of broccoli, a row of butter lettuce, a row of yellow beans, a long row of mammoth sunflowers! I did end up planting 16 corns plants late which I never expected to see anything on! I didn‚Äôt do anything special to the soil, I flipped it and tried to get as much of the grass roots out.

My SIL lived here for 6 years before us and never noticed them. Before that the house sat empty for 17 years.  I'm the only person that's ever harvested from them and they're finally being fully appreciated. Silly thought I know but it's nice to think.

Advice needed,"Hi all - this tree is in my (currently unkept) back garden which has been neglected due to a big building project on the house and now needs proper planning. My apps tell me it‚Äôs a Japanese red cedar although I‚Äôm not too convinced as some images don‚Äôt seem to match. However it‚Äôs become quite wide and I‚Äôm not sure whether to prune it or chop it down (we‚Äôve two free surgeons come look at it and both just wanted to chop it down and I soon realised they were just focused on getting the bigger price for that!) There‚Äôs obviously no right answer but I‚Äôm curious what others would do. The garden is south facing and it does block some light to the garden but mostly against the back wall which you can see although even with it gone it wouldn‚Äôt be a sun trap there. I do like the privacy it gives me as there is a 2 storey house directly behind however I could replace it would some 8ft-ish trees to at least give privacy to their lower floor. I have a little girl and imagined putting a swing on a branch for her however one branch did come down in a recent storm and I‚Äôm wondering whether replacing with a climbing frame is more practical. One main sticking point is I‚Äôve read you can‚Äôt easily prune conifers as the needles only grow from  where the needles already are - so for example as the branches have only the needles on the end as they keep growing out they get too long and if I cut a branch in half to expose just a woody end then no new needles grow, so in theory you‚Äôre always just having to tip prune. I can‚Äôt get a straight answer on this but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read so curious on others‚Äô thoughts here! Thanks!",214,431,0.88,gardening

I've taken to gardening after dark, but I miss gardening during the day time. Does anyone else here have tips on how to garden with severe insect allergies?

16s0oph,1695668428.0,Lost the sun in 1/3 of my garden,"The shifting fall sun has caused me to lose sunlight in a large portion of my garden and I‚Äôm at a total loss for what to do. In spring I moved my garden setup to this area on the south side of my house. I took extensive measurements of the sunlight at all parts of the space every hour of the day in both mid May and June to help determine where to plant everything. But I did not take into account that the sun would move lower behind my neighbors annoying 3-story house and block a third of my garden ALL DAY.

This picture was taken around noon, and I‚Äôve tracked the sun again from 7am to 6pm and the left side gets no bright, direct sunlight all day. It‚Äôs pretty sad because my pepper plants all ended up in that far left corner, and have produced very little this month. When they were planted, that area got 7-8 hours of sun a day. 

We‚Äôre in zone 5b, Denver area, so I figure it‚Äôs way too close to first frost to spend time trying to move or fix anything. So this season is probably a loss. But I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any tips for next season. Anything that I could plant there that could tolerate sun in July/August and shade in September? Or should I only use that area for cool weather plants and leave it empty in the hottest month? Or should I consider relocating some of my garden boxes all together?",43,237,0.96,gardening

16u0yby,1695860266.0,Anything I can do about neighbor‚Äôs trees of heaven?,"About 3 years ago, my neighbor, Ron, claimed my labradoodle, Sadie, was petrifying to his daughters (teenagers), when Sadie was still a puppy. My wife and I were already planning on fencing in the backyard, so I reassured him Sadie‚Äôs reign of terror would soon end.

A few months after fencing in the yard, Ron texted me. Which is weird because I forgot I even gave him my number. But weirder because he texted me, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre you planning on doing with your backyard?‚Äù After pondering his rationale of asking such a thing, I replied that we would keep up with the lawn (yea, it‚Äôs due for a mow, but it‚Äôs been raining practically every weekend this summer + I have a toddler that wants my undivided attention = daughter over lawn), let our arborvitae‚Äôs plotted along our back fence grow out (Ron‚Äôs house is on my left), and keep a garden bed (directly below his now impeding and growing TOH‚Äôs pictured). He replied something about how much easier it is to cover the back half of the yard off with tarp because it‚Äôs not worth keeping up with. Believe it or not, at the time, the back of his yard was not too shabby.

For reference, we live in a relatively busy suburban area, on a steep hill above one of our city‚Äôs main roads. The steep hill separating us from the main road also takes up the back half of Ron and I‚Äôs backyards (see the big dips in the fencing). So I get where he was coming from about essentially giving up on the back part of the yard. It can be a pain in the ass to maintain. However, I didn‚Äôt think he actually would let his go to the point where it‚Äôs riddled with such invasiveness. Especially after I told him I disagreed with his suggestion.

Which leads me here, looking for advice on what I can do to not let Ron‚Äôs heavenly yard ruin mine. Only things I can think of are probably not legal. And I‚Äôm not really looking to go to small claims court with Ron over it either. No time for that with the wife and I both working, having a toddler, and another baby on the way‚Ä¶

Willing to slightly bend moral ethics, but again, trying to keep it legal. Not because I‚Äôm an outstanding citizen, more that I know Ron has called the cops insisiting his house was broken into. While he was home. More than once. Where each time - that I‚Äôm aware of at least - I was doing something in my backyard.",85,136,0.87,gardening

It looks stellar red all around, but still has a bit of white towards the stem and what looks like the start of some brown spots(?). Feels a little bit firm, it takes a little bit more force to deform it than I was expecting.

The big tree is not in that area, the small tree is. I do not want to relocate the small tree, but if it could happen for the right idea. The planter and the fire ring can be re/moved. I want to maintain a fire ring and it must be 10 feet from the garage and deck, however I would sacrifice it begrudgingly for efficiency. My zone is 4a according to google (Red Wing, MN). I volunteer at a food shelf and can donate all the food I grow, so super growers like zucchini are cool in large numbers. I‚Äôm also going to be eating from these so variety is appreciated. My neighborhood is plagued with dirty little bunnies, so there‚Äôs that. This area gets full sun. 

Me: 42, retired, can perform strenuous physical tasks, can easily carry 50 dog food bags. Grug, but can follow directions gud. I have had a garden of various sizes for 5 seasons. I successfully grew cukes, zucchini, squash, and dill. I tried growing romanesco broccoli but it only grew leaves. That is my experience growing things to completion. I am ready to invest 3-4 hours per day maximum to this endeavor.

The mission: using the information above how would you spend 1500-2000$ US (maybe a little more if it means feeding a lot more people) if you were setting up a garden? Is it possible to do something that will grow veggies all year? 

Bonus: there‚Äôs a 12 foot by 12 foot area behind the garage that gets full shade. Is there anything I could bring to the food shelf that grows in full shade in area 4a?

I bought a house about 3 years ago with a large, mature avocado tree in the yard. It is probably 20-30 years old, although possibly older. It produces an absolutely insane harvest every year of avocados that are nothing short of amazing. Here is a list of their qualities:

- They are huge, like up to the size of a football huge. 2-3 lbs per avo is pretty standard, but occasionally I have one that's over 4lbs. I am going to start being better about weighing them because I think there's been a couple that were 5lbs but I didn't weigh it. People are happy to pay $3-4 per avo on my roadside stand. 

- They have a small seed relative to their size. Even one of the smaller avocados will produce 3+ cups of mashed fruit. The tree produces around 100 mature fruits over a 2-3 month period.  

- They DON'T BROWN. I can make guacamole and it lasts in the fridge for over a week with zero browning. This is the main thing that I feel could make it a commercially successful avo. 

- They have a delicious, creamy texture with a rich buttery flavor. No stringyness, and the flesh has an attractive golden hue when fully ripe. 

- They can be picked early and last for several weeks before ripening. Once they start to ripen, they have a 2-3 day window of peak ripeness. You can refrigerate them at that point and they will stay perfect for more than a week with no reduction in flavor or texture quality. 

- The tree is deciduous and drops all of its leaves in January which seems to protect it from the avocado lace bug. My neighbor's avo tree is heavily impacted by it. 


I'm in Hawaii so we are in the land of great and unique avocados. But this one really does seem like it has all the qualities you want in an avo. I live on a really small lot, so trying to graft and farm this tree on my own property isn't an option. I just feel like this avo could be a contender for a successful commercial crop. But I don't have any experience farming. I know avos need to be grafted once you find a good tree. Seems like the only commercial variety is Hass these days, but this avo seems to me to be superior in every way. Is there such thing as avocado licensing lol?

In July, I got the seeds and grew it in a coco peat mix for 2 weeks and once it grew a bit long and started having 3-4 leaves, I planted it in a hydroponics setup I build myself. It‚Äôs been atleast 100 days and I am yet to see a bulb form on it even though it has a lot of leaves and decent stalk size and I don‚Äôt have any clue why.

I am from India and the months of July was probably warmer than what broccoli needs, but I went at it anyway. Also at one point there was a rat eating the top portion of the plant, I had that dealt with. Anything I can do to get the plant to grow bulbs and eventually get some broccoli.

All the seedlings I planted were from a common yellow passion fruit plant. I'm curious, can anyone tell me what might have happened? Is it possible that my passion fruit plant underwent some mutation? Or could it be due to the soil composition?

First year gardening, and outside of the abject failure of our carrots and onions, everything else was fair to call a success. Particularly, as you can see, the tomatoes. And as much as we love tomatoes, we're definitely going to need to find some folks to offload some of these.

The varieties we grew were Italian Roma, Roma VF, San Marzano, and Beefsteak. Both Roma varieties were the most vigorous and provided the most consistent harvest. San Marzano were pretty good. Beefsteak proved the most difficult, being prone to splitting and slow to grow and rippen.

We additionally grew green beans of the Harvester Bush variety, which were awesome and produced like mad...until the grasshoppers came. I have made mortal enemies of these creatures.

And, most interestingly, we had a volunteer pumpkin plant! You can look back in my post history where I sought an ID for a mystery plant that appeared in spring.

It‚Äôs been atleast 100 days and I am yet to see a bulb form on it even though it has a lot of leaves and decent stalk size and I don‚Äôt have any clue why.

I am from India and the months of July was probably warmer than what broccoli needs, but I went at it anyway. Also at one point there was a rat eating the top portion of the plant, I had that dealt with. Anything I can do to get the plant to grow bulbs and eventually get some broccoli.

First year gardening, and outside of the abject failure of our carrots and onions, everything else was fair to call a success. Particularly, as you can see, the tomatoes. And as much as we love tomatoes, we're definitely going to need to find some folks to offload some of these.

The varieties we grew were Italian Roma, Roma VF, San Marzano, and Beefsteak. Both Roma varieties were the most vigorous and provided the most consistent harvest. San Marzano were pretty good. Beefsteak proved the most difficult, being prone to splitting and slow to grow and rippen.

We additionally grew green beans of the Harvester Bush variety, which were awesome and produced like mad...until the grasshoppers came. I have made mortal enemies of these creatures.

And, most interestingly, we had a volunteer pumpkin plant! You can look back in my post history where I sought an ID for a mystery plant that appeared in spring. I thought it a unique looking weed at first and decided to let it be, where it eventually sprawled several meters from its little corner of the bed.

Back Row - Holy Basil (Green & Purple: Ram and Krishna)

Front Row - Left Side - Marigold

Front Row - Right Side - Holy Basil and Cilantro

Seedling Case - Marigold Seedlings (50-70x)

Black Pot - More Holy Basil

The reason for having so many Basil plants, is that I want to have enough to produce thousands of tulsi seeds because I need it every year. But! It‚Äôs also super invasive because it‚Äôs seeds always fall off and fly away. So I transplanted the invasive seedlings into the black temporary pot. The Marigolds are the quickest to germinate in my stock right, with less than roughly 2 days for it to start.

Cilantro are also my fast germinators, but only if wettened.

Also getting into strawberry. I ordered 4 strawberry plants, which came as 8, but dormant and are starting to shine again.

Small pots on the bottom are just transplanted marigolds and trial at having more cilantro.

4. My last rubber plant died, so  I got a new one last month. I have been taking really good care of it, after lots of research, the baby is thriving.
5. I learned how to make home made neem water as organic pesticides, and it's working so well.
6. I found earthworms in a nursery, so got some to add to outdoor soil. I added a layer of mulch to it, food for the worms. Hopefully after 90 days I shall have my very own vermi compost
7. I planted 6 asiatic lilies, the bulbs grew into tall plants within 19 days, waiting for them to blossom. 
8. I have 4 huge aloe plants that I plan on using for skincare and haircare.

Frankly I'm addicted to gardening now. It's so therapeutic. Nurturing the plants, watching them thrive, I feel sense of pride.

So my mom planted two amaryllis bulbs in this pot a few years back. This was soon forgotten and neglected. It had greenery and it did let out one or two flowers every now and then. It looked overcrowded, as you can see in pictures 1 and 2.

I was gonna throw it out and plant something else but thought to myself why not try to separate the bulbs for the hell of it. So I did. Turns out there were 92 bulbs of varying shapes and sizes in the pot, as seen in pictures 3-5 (picture 5 is of the smallest one I found).

I have absolutely no experience with amaryllis. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do with these? (as in like do I plant them in individual pots? Do I do something before I plant them? Again, no experience whatsoever with this) Their roots were incredibly tangled so I had to cut and rip. 

Also if anyone can tell me what those growths in pictures 6 and 7 are, would be much appreciated.",9,7,0.89,gardening

May i ask:
Are these dill seedlings too leggy?  It rains a lot here so i need to put them under a glass roof and they may not be getting too much direct sunlight.  They r out in the open whole day though

Are they too crowded for now?  I am planning to thin them out at some point but not sure when.  Was thinking once true leaves come out and if they start pushing each other's leaves

Any other suggestions? 

I tried growing dill in 2 inch deep mini posts before but after a week or so in this stage they died off.  I figured they were indoors before and pots were too shallow.  Tried large pot this time and deeper.   Had dead batch of earlier seeds so i just over planted this time i guess. 

Looking forward to more dill :)

175feqe,1697034720.0,Hydrangeas wilting,"Hello, I'm new to gardening entirely but I've recently started taking care of some plants I've always wanted to have when I was a kid, one of then being a hydrangea. 

I bought some from our local plant center and they looked alive and beautiful when I brought them home last October 9th. However, I noticed that in the evening the flowers started wilting and in the days to follow, some of the leaves started turning brown and crispy. 

I'm just worried about her. I was anticipating some shock from being moved from one location to another (it's why I held off on immediately repotting her from the nursery bag she was in to the bigger pot I got) but I've been watering her every morning and making sure the soil in her nursery bag is damp. 

I live in a tropical country and it can get pretty hot. I'm trying (and struggling ) to find the balance between watering enough to keep it happy and healthy and not overwatering that I cause it root rot. 

Earlier today I saw that more leaves had gotten scorched so I was thinking maybe it's getting too much sun so I've moved it somewhere it'll only get sun until around 9 am. 

I've given its soil some humic plus and also the other day sprayed a bit of plant food on the underside of its healthy leaves (they're still okay) but the scorched/brown and crispy i left alone. 

Should I transplant it to a bigger pot? Should I snip off the crispy brown leaves? 

Any help or advice is appreciated. I don't want to kill my first hydrangea ü•≤

They nearly died, shed all their leaves and were looking pretty sad. We managed to save them with water and shade but now they are putting out tiny new leaves and showing signs of life just as it's getting cold outside. We are in 5b, so winter is just around the corner and these little guys are emerging like it's springtime.

Now the big question. Do we try and overwinter these plants indoors to let them recover a bit or is the smart move to allow them to go dormant with the weather change and hope they make it through to next spring. The ground isn't frozen yet so they could be planted out, but I'd be afraid the transplant shock would kill them just as they're coming back to life. On the other hand, letting them freeze in pots may very well do the same.

Quite the conundrum.

Other pollinators too, but these are my favorite. I like to photograph them, and I just overall like seeing them. I'm trying to keep the footprint fairly small at the moment.

This is my current plant list. Mostly based on plants I've seen a lot of native bees and wasps on. My soil is acidic heavy clay. Whatever you imagine when you read that, it's significantly heavier clay than that. 


- Chaste tree - probably planted separately to avoid shading everything else out. Attracts lots of bees
- high bush blueberry - for the blueberry digger bees.
- goldenrod - slender and seaside varieties. 
- swamp milkweed and tuberosa milkweed - can't not include this.
- Honeycomb buddleia
- coral bells azalea for a border. I'd like to change this to something else as they don't really get much bee traffic. They are a cheap (frequently $5 per small plant after they drop blooms), neat looking, evergreen plant that will reduce the weedy look though, which is important.
- sterile lantana variety - same purpose as the azaleas. Another one that I wouldn't mind substituting, they really don't attract many insects considering the huge number of flowers - they are very easy to shape though, and they thrive in my crappy soil.

The azaleas (or their replacement), milkweeds and goldenrod, I plan to load up on. The lantana too, but to a lesser degree. Everything else will be single specimens except for the blueberries, which I already have 2-3 of and will be transplanting. 

I was hoping for suggestions on an alternative to the azaleas and lantana, and anything that fills blooming time gaps. I think early spring and late summer might be kind of light. Thanks for any help!",3,2,1.0,gardening

The person we bought it off said it can only grow to 4 metres and that it is a one of the slower growing types. The bamboo is filled with moulded areas where the leaves meet the stem. Half the stems are yellowed and their isn‚Äôt much consistency or symmetry in growth. 

The other issue is that they‚Äôre attracting wasps. So now I have a bamboo cemetery with flying pain extractors. I was also looking for recommendations on plants (I saw natives were suitable) that aren‚Äôt toxic to dogs which attract small birds (which eat wasps). 

My neighbour told me that you should trim the stems to stimulate growth which I have now realised was incorrect. It apparently stunts the growth. Also, I‚Äôve literally only started watering them properly as I thought they were the plant version of a camel. There has been some growth since the more frequent watering. I also was putting that eco-oil on the bamboo to deter pests. 

The point I‚Äôm getting at, is it now almost impossible to birth these things back to health or should I rip them out and start again? The soil in my area sucks too, it‚Äôs half clay. I‚Äôve just had this sudden realisation that there‚Äôs a large purple elephant in my backyard that I haven‚Äôt even noticed.

175q6sw,1697061512.0,New bed,Neighbor allowed me to garden an old unused 10x16 plot. Everything did mediocre this year in there but his soil is dirt and so I went with it. The sweet corn and tomatoes I harvested and cut plants at soil level and kept roots in ground as I always do. After harvesting pumpkins I noticed two things: one is that I had 3 varieties that all looked the exact same shade of dull orange. 15 feet away I have another garden bed of my own with a single vine of the same variety as one of the 3 in my neighbors bed. This vine is much healthier and the fruits are more vibrantly orange. This was my first clue. Then I pulled one of the squash plants out of the ground and saw the roots looked unhealthy. The vine with the vibrant squash 15 feet away still has one more that I‚Äôm letting to so I haven‚Äôt been able to inspect the roots yet. What is the cause of these roots and inability to fully express their genetic potential ie color and possibly flavor and overall plant health. Could it be a pathogen? Pests like a nematode etc?

Background: I bought a house in LA six years ago and the house came with a few rows of drought resistant landscaping out front‚Äî rosemary, succulents, a fruiting loquat tree, Bougainville‚Äî and I kept on the house‚Äôs once a month gardener who speaks no English. (I speak very little Spanish.) Six years ago I bought a passionfruit plant at a farmers market and planted at the front row of my garden, followed the care instructions (which I‚Äôve since forgotten) for a while and gave up over time when it seemed to be dying and wasn‚Äôt producing any fruit. 

A few years ago I noticed the plant had survived, grown sideways, and seemed to be over growing/strangling a flowering thorny bush at the corner of my garden fence. Still no fruit, and I assumed there never would be.

Fast forward to yesterday when my new next door neighbor informs me they are soon going to be aggressively trimming the bush as it is growing over the corner of my fence onto their property. I said of course, but that‚Äôs when noticed the invading passionfruit vines were finally fruiting! Somewhere between ten and fifteen green passionfruits, most on my side or the street side of the fence, about a third growing onto my neighbor‚Äôs side.

I‚Äôm delighted by this surprise. Not sure ‚Äúwhy now‚Äù except perhaps the unusually rainy year gave the plant what it needed to produce. 

I would like to save the plant and start actually tending to it so it can produce for years to come, but as you can see from the photos it‚Äôs all mixed up and entangled with the corner plant and I don‚Äôt know the first thing about how to separate them or care for them beyond what my gardener does on a monthly basis. I don‚Äôt even know the name of the plant it has overtaken, or when best to pluck the fruit‚Ä¶ is it green passionfruit or do I need to wait until it darkens? It feels moderately ‚Äúfull‚Äù to the touch but I have no idea how full they are‚Ä¶ or if they‚Äôve been sufficiently watered to be juicy/edible. I also intend to let my neighbor trim what they need to, but wonder if there is any kind of collaboration/intervention I could arrange to steer the plant back my way‚Ä¶ though I understand my gardening failures may mean it‚Äôs too late.

Again, I apologize for the infodump. I appreciate any feedback, insights, guesses, or advice! Thank you.",3,2,1.0,gardening

They looked very sad, had droopy leaves, didn't gain any height (less than an inch out of the cococoir) but small inklings of true leave spikes were starting, albeit very slowly. 

To my great surprise, when I transplanted all the seedlings (including the ""control group"") the small, sad looking seedlings had AMAZING roots! Like many LONG parallel roots, with TONS of perpendicular tendrils....total root mass was easily comparable to the seedlings which had multiple true leaves out, and several inches tall.

Seems like since the plant wasn't getting much nutrients without mycelial symbiosis, so all the growth energy was going into root systems, searching for nutrients.

179o0ce,1697510236.0,Plants that resemble puncturevine leaves???,"I'll try to add a picture tomorrow when it's light if no one has any thoughts on this.

I'm attempting to identify plants in my yard to eradicate early before they become worse pests. I live on a mostly un-landscaped acre (I rent) in the SoCal desert on a sand lot. It's still nearly 90 here, and everything is still growing. I'm still yanking ragweed, which is literally five feet tall in my neighbors' yards. One of my dogs is allergic. Gah.

After the heavy rains of this past winter and spring, I have a lot of what looks like puncturevine that hasn't spread into those long whips. I did pull the obvious puncturevine plants, as those burrs are NASTY and constantly get in my dogs' paws and in the soles of my shoes. But I have some other plants that look just like puncturevine leaves but never grow longer -- they look almost like tiny fern-y ground cover.

At first I thought they were a different sex of the puncturevine, but then I read puncturevine is hermaphroditic.  Is it possibly another less invasive/harmful caltrop species? If they flowered, it was early in the spring before they were so abundant, so that doesn't help. I've searched and searched online and can't find the information I need.

I don't want to bother hoeing it out if it's harmless. I pretty much leave everything native in the yard for the birds and the bees if it's not hurting me or the pets.

TIA. :)

179f9p6,1697486720.0,Pineapples! A how-to guide to grow & care for your own :),"About 25 years ago I moved from New England, which is full of seasons, to a little peninsula in South Florida with a very tropical year-round climate‚Ä¶ which is where I discovered my love for Bromeliads and have been growing them ever since!

Pineapples are a variety of Bromeliad, I have been growing generational pineapples for many years. And while they do prefer to grow in a climate like mine, they can be grown in all other zones, as long as their needs are met, which are quite simple really. 
____
Pineapple plants are very resilient and they have simple needs: warm weather, sunshine, water, quick draining soil, & time (lots & lots of time). 

- The preferred growing zone is 11-12. 

- As far as temperature; they fruit optimally between 68-86¬∞F, anything below 60 or above 90 will still suffice, it just slows down the growth rate.

An easy solution is to grow them in pots! I do this even here so they can be easily moved around during the seasons to get shade during high-heat. If you do have frost where you are, they can grow outside in the summer and inside in the winter (just put them in your sunniest window). They have a pretty shallow root system, so the pot size can be pretty small compared to the adult plant size. 

I generally like to use the fabric grow bags for pots, because of their lightweight & great draining. 

- For water; since they are a Bromeliad, they have a built-in water tank! Which is located in the central part of the plant stem that is created by the leaves shaping into a hollow cylinder. They need to keep this constantly full of water (and is how they collect and store rain and dew naturally).  

Once the ground roots are established in soil, they do not need much water at all, overfilling the plants water tank when it‚Äôs low to allow a decent trickling into the soil is sufficient. 

- For soil; they prefer fast draining and to not have their ground roots soaking in water.

I like to use Miracle Grows ‚ÄúCactus, Palm & Citrus Potting Mix‚Äù in the orange bag. However, there are bromeliad specific soils that can be used. And make sure your pot has enough drainage holes.

- For time; this will vary significantly based on all the factors listed above and how the plant is started. Even in ideal growing conditions the time is extensive, I will list the times based on my climate (which is ideal for pineapples)

For growing from a topper; it will take 24-36 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop.

For growing from a pup or slip; it will take 12-18 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop. 

*this is why generational pineapple plants are the preferred growing method*
____
Other things to know about pineapples:

- They will not survive 28¬∞F or lower, this will destroy the entire plant and all parts. 

- The parent plant will only produce one pineapple fruit and then die. 

- The parent plant will produce pups & slips. 

- Not all pineapple plant varieties produce slips, but all will produce at least 1 pup. 

- Most parent plants will produce more pups once the previous pups have been removed. 
___
Pineapple parent plants will produce up to 4 ways to propagate future pineapple plants. 

- Toppers are the crown of the fruit itself

- Slips grow from the top of peduncle stem and base of the fruit

- Aerial pups grow from aerial roots located in between the leaves 

- Ground pups grow from the main root stem under the soil or at the very base of the plant
____
Toppers are a great way to start on your pineapple plant journey!

- Pick a fruit with vibrant green leaves to start with, the healthier your starting point = the healthier your plant

- Remove the topper from the fruit, I like to leave about 1/2 inch of the actual fruit part to use the core as part of the main stem for stability reasons

- Clean off any excess fruit with a paring knife; I like to score the fruit from the bottom first

- Clean off lower layers of leaves to expose root nodes by gently grabbing each leaf and peeling from side to side (you‚Äôll notice leaves at the base of the topper are much smaller than the ones at the top: remove all those small leaves)

Slips, if your plant produces them, should be removed pretty quickly from the fruit base, since it directly drains energy from fruit development. If you plan to propagate with them, allow them to grow at least 2‚Äù in size first. (I just quickly dispose of these when they start to happen)

- The fruit base will have its own independent leaves, so make sure to properly identify a slip, which would look like a small topper growing out

- Firmly grab and twist off while supporting the fruit and stem to prevent damage

Aerial pups are the easiest and best to use for propagating, they do not feed off of the parent plant (they will drink out of the tank water supply) and come off very easily. 

- When they are about 4-6‚Äù in size, firmly grab them and twist them right off. 

Ground pups are also very common to develop, but can be hard to see at first since they might be buried and not as easy to remove. 

- You can try to twist them off once they‚Äôre about 5-8‚Äù in size

- You can cut them off of the main root

- You can just leave them alone and once the parent plant dies off, they will take over the pot. (this is not as aesthetically pleasing)

- You can wait until the parent plant dies off, then just pull them apart and repot them directly into soil

To root all of the above future plants: the easiest way is to simply put them in a glass vessel full of water and place in a windowsill!

- Make sure the mouth of the container is smaller than the leaves, the plant will hold itself up

- Keep the water supply up to the bottom of the leaves where the root nodes live

- Remove it every few days to rinse the roots off, rinse the vessel out, and refill with fresh water to keep it healthy

- Once roots develop, plant growth is noticed, and a decent cylindrical hole is in the center of the leaves.. it can be transplanted to soil. 

- If you would like to stall their growth cycle, just continue to keep them happy & healthy in the water. I do this for a couple of reasons; to have multiple parent plants fruiting at different times and to have a back-up saved for emergencies, the longest I have stalled a pup is 18 months! (that one is the one in my photos, it‚Äôs entire family was destroyed in hurricane Ian)

- Once potted, water both the leaf tank and the soil frequently until a growth spurt happens, then you can just overfill the leaf tank. (that means the plant established itself and transfer to soil was successful)
____
I am including some photos to help give a visual for you to refer to!

- I drew & labeled parts of the parent plant for you 

- I have included photos of other bromeliads with examples of both aerial & ground pups

- There is a current pineapple plant growing with an extra photo of spikes developing on the sides of the leaves, not all varieties have them (these will tear you up! They will grow to be razor sharp! I use elbow high leather gloves to care for my pineapple plants)

- Photos of me using a very crappy store bought pineapple (it‚Äôs all they had, I‚Äôm so sorry!) as an example step by step for turning your own fruit into a plant. 

Please pick a nicer & healthier looking pineapple topper to use!!

You will notice the core in the fruit & me scoring that, removing all the fruit bits, peeling the leaves off, and the small little bumps & wiggles that are aerial root nodes (those are the parts you want to submerge in the water!)
____
Make sure that your pineapple fruit or plant is an edible variety (like from a fruit in the grocery store produce) and not an ornamental variety, if you plant to eat them. But, if you just want to grow them for looks, taking care of an ornamental or dwarf plant is the same, just on a smaller scale.

178nfms,1697399456.0,Looking for plants and flowers safe for my indoor cats.,"(Our cats are indoor only, to be precise)

We weren't sure whether to ask this on a local Montreal subreddit for the few people that might know flowers and plants or to come to a gardening subreddit that might know different regions but asking here makes more sense.

This was never an issue until our recently adopted senior boy went for our Virginia Creeper and English Ivy, lavender and other plants. Our previous cat didn't care for them at all, so ok, now we have a cat that goes for toxic plants.

So the question is, knowing that we are in Montreal (hardiness zone 5b) and that we happen to get very little direct light on our balcony or through our windows but a very good amount of non direct daylight all day because of our exposure, what flowers, plants, small trees and bushes can we have that won't kill our cats? Aesthetically, we had been going for a very traditional English garden look with our overall balcony and indoor gardening but not harming our cats is obviously a greater priority than aesthetics.

177gsjw,1697255607.0,Starting Seeds During Autumn Indoors.,"Sooo this is my first year gardening and I've gotten really into growing plants from seed. I've done this completely indoors since I started gardening in April in zone 8b (Seattle area). I was afraid of starting them outdoors and it getting too hot when they're too young, so I've moved them outside throughout the summer as they've gotten big enough. I have some seedlings that I started in the middle of September that will obviously wait to go outside until after any danger of frost, with it being October. I plan to start seeds throughout fall and winter but I was curious of people's personal experiences with growing plants from seeds during this time of year. 

I guess my main question is, do seeds ""know"" it's winter, despite growlights, consitent temperature, etc? Maybe it's just a few plants in particular, but I've noticed them growing slower this last week, and my main concern is obviously the plants getting too big before winter is over. 

What are your guys' experiences with growing seeds in the winter indoors? I'm not talking about vegetables and herbs, as I stick to ornamental plants mainly. Examples of seedlings I have now are Celosia, Amaranth, Snapdragon, Scabiosa, and Lupine to name a few.

Oh and a general question, when do people start watering seedlings like they are adults?",1,1,1.0,gardening

Planted these Hydrangeas today. The closest one was the first planting, I decided to move the second farther away since leaves were larger. Currently wondering if the first is too close to the structure and whether it would be better to move tomorrow (would be about 18 hours after planting) or let it ride to avoid additional shock.

Any thoughts are appreciated. I am also very open to advice on preparation. I amended the top 12‚Äù or so of the soil across the row (2-3 ft width) with mushroom compost and organic outdoor planting soil before digging the holes (deeper than 12‚Äù), filling with additional outdoor planting soil, fertilizing, and mulching.

I‚Äôm considering taking the soil between the plants (5 ft spacing currently) to shovel depth and amending the same way to allow for sideways growth, is this warranted or overkill?

So my partner and I have been ramping up our garden and plan to add 4 more 4ft x 8ft 12"" deep raised beds next year. Our current 2 I placed on lawn soil that I turned over before filling with new compost soil, and they worked out decently  though we had a lot of rain and I think there was too much organic matter to drain well in the early months.
For the new ones where we want to place them is somewhat unique. My property had an above ground pool when I moved in that I removed immediately. Underneath is a base layer of sand (possibly on top of gravel also possibly with a plastic liner) approx 25ft diameter. This is hands down the sunniest spot of our yard, so it is where we plan to put the new beds. The sand is fairly hard packed, but drains pretty well as you would imagine sand would, it is at least 18-24 inches of sand and might have gravel beneath but I actually didn't dig any up when I dug in for the depth check, so it might just be 2 ft of sand on native soil. Native soil is fairly sandy as we are in a river delta. My goal for the beds is a sandy loam to grow mostly cucurbits in, and it will be drip irrigated for when rain isn't sufficient. I dont think there is a hard pan going on.
So specifically, short of digging up and replacing 128-256 cubic feet of sand by hand, what can I do to be sure these new beds drain properly? 
I figure in the least I will break up the sand some down to 12-18"" so it isn't as hard packed. I also considered driving small 1"" x 4ft softwood stakes through the sand that sit somewhat flush with the bottom of the raised bed every 2sqft. My thought here is that it will guarantee a hole through to subsoil for water to drain in case there is a plastic liner or gravel, and over time will decompose but remain a drainage channel.

If the original underwatering was still taking her toll, why did she go through a green growth phase? Why did she turn yellow and brown only a week after receiving water?

I learned thyme is drought tolerant and to err on less water. I was afraid somehow the soil was retaining too much moisture (even though it had that soil for a year w/o problems), so I didn‚Äôt water it again for two weeks. 

Factors: There is a chance I put her outside and the water evaporated, but I am uncertain if I did this. I also put her under a grow light for that week. She also had mold caked onto the soil that I removed.  

What can I do to give her hope? 

I‚Äôve pruned her a bit already, and it‚Äôs been 4 days since she‚Äôs been barren. How can I prune her more to make for the highest chance of survival and new growth?

175utnc,1697074299.0,Seed-eating animal,"Just started replanting my small garden (amateur flower lover), going good so far, but one particular area keeps on getting bombarded with some flower-seed loving animal. I've even added netting over the entire bed then replanted/seeded, which has seemed to work in the past, but these holes have popped up again and I think I need to replant there. 

Any thoughts on what the animal might be (just out of curiousity), or solutions?

My hypothesis is that crows are getting to it, despite the netting (the netting is not very tight, will pretty easily bend to touch the soil if i apply enough weight, which is what I will attempt next if no one has any other suggestions)

Would be interesting if there are some weird soil watering physics or underground animal that could be the cause of this?

Almost always, the remaining branches/sections of the affected bush are still doing well enough that they're growing new growth. Many of the leaves both summers developed a bit of a dull/mottled appearance, but I've never seen more obvious signs of mites or any other pests. They've been watered well and consistently. However, overwatering/root rot seems unlikely given the heat and dryness this summer and the fact that grey, soggy winter did not see real progression of the problem or additional sections dying off.

1792bx2,1697449952.0,Grow light recommendations for money-plant on 5ft high trellis in a shaded window,"**Context:** My money plant is not growing too well on this trellis. The leaves are yellowing and falling-off two often and the growth is very slow (compared to other money plants which are lying in a balcony which receives good sunlight)

**About the trellis:** The trellis in question is 5 feet high and is installed outside a window which doesn't get much sunlight (mostly reflected sunlight). The picture taken below is at 3pm -- at this time the sun is shining really bright and it's uncomfortable standing out in the open for too long, but this trellis isn't getting much sunlight.

**Question:** The FAQ/wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/wiki/faq/lighting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/wiki/faq/lighting/) recommends having the grow light **2 inches** away from the plant? **Is this applicable to my case as well?** What kind of grow lights would you recommend for my situation?

I‚Äôm new here and hopefully this is the right place to ask! Basically my wife and I decided to clean out our flower beds to start fresh!

We have a yellow colored home and decided that we want a calm color scheme. Blues, purples, whites and maybe a splash of pink here and there. We are choosing multiple dwarf variants to our azaleas and plan on adding a few foxtail turns, 3 frost proof gardenias to the edges of our beds along with three dwarf black diamonds crepe myrtles!

1794igq,1697458276.0,BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE," 

The frequency of adding humus and compost to your vegetable garden is determined by various factors. Generally, a recommended practice is to introduce compost once a year, either in the spring or fall. 

[BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE: A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO RECYCLE](https://lovjoyfulgarden.com/bucket-composting-at-home-small-space-a-sustainable-way-to-recycle/)

1. For vegetables that will be consumed raw, it's recommended to apply composted manure at least 60 days prior to harvest. Ideally, apply the manure in the fall to give ample time for the decomposition of any potential pathogens before planting your garden in the spring. This approach ensures the safety of your fresh produce for uncooked consumption.

2. Refrain from using cat, dog, or pig manures in your gardens or compost piles, as these may harbor parasites that can endure and pose health risks to humans.

3. Avoid applying manure once your garden is already planted.

Prior to consumption, ensure thorough washing of uncooked vegetables.

4. Individuals at heightened risk of foodborne illnesses, including pregnant women, young children, and those with underlying health conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes, or AIDS, should steer clear of consuming raw vegetables from gardens fertilized with manure.

This replenishes nutrients and enhances soil structure. For humus, consider adding it every 2-3 years to maintain organic matter content. However, the specific needs of your garden can vary, so it's advisable to perform soil tests to determine nutrient levels and adjust your application schedule accordingly. Balancing the soil's organic matter is essential for healthy and productive vegetable growth.",0,0,0.25,gardening

(Pics show degression),"Hello Earthly Caretakers, my thyme plant was under watered (going 2-4 weeks without water). I watered her, and she began to turn green and flourish as in the first pic.   

But then by the end of the week all her leaves turned yellow and brown, crinkly tipped. I was perplexed on why she was dying after going through a growth phase, and I became afraid of giving her more water. Was it still the original underwatering taking a toll? 

The 1st picture was two weeks ago when she had a drink. The 2nd picture is just this last Saturday, when she began to turn yellow and brown-tipped. She still had green, but she turned brown in the 3rd picture by Wednesday. And the 4th picture is her before pruning: very barren. The last pic is after pruning, today. 

How can I prune her to give her the best chance at regrowth? Two people have said to prune all of her branches off to give her a chance to refresh, but I‚Äôm afraid to do this. It‚Äôs hard to see in the picture, but there are tiny green buds (smaller than a gnat) on some of the branches. Should I still prune her entirely, or leave these for photosynthesis?

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

Fast forward to today, I noticed the leaf spot disease wasn't fully healed, and the leaves(?) on the ripening persimmons had spots. I also noticed a couple of mealybugs near the stem of the fruitüò≠ I treated the tree again with neem oil last night but the damage is already done

Would these persimmons be safe to eat? I
sprayed 70% alcohol on the stem area where I saw a mealybug and drenched the fruits in dawn dish soap + water.

This is my current plant list. Mostly based on plants I've seen a lot of native bees and wasps on. My soil is acidic heavy clay. Whatever you imagine when you read that, it's significantly heavier clay than that. 


- Chaste tree - probably planted separately to avoid shading everything else out. Attracts lots of bees
- high bush blueberry - for the blueberry digger bees.
- goldenrod - slender and seaside varieties. 
- swamp milkweed and tuberosa milkweed - can't not include this.
- Honeycomb buddleia
- coral bells azalea for a border. I'd like to change this to something else as they don't really get much bee traffic. They are a cheap (frequently $5 per small plant after they drop blooms), neat looking, evergreen plant that will reduce the weedy look though, which is important.
- sterile lantana variety - same purpose as the azaleas. Another one that I wouldn't mind substituting, they really don't attract many insects considering the huge number of flowers - they are very easy to shape though, and they thrive in my crappy soil.

The azaleas (or their replacement), milkweeds and goldenrod, I plan to load up on. The lantana too, but to a lesser degree. Everything else will be single specimens except for the blueberries, which I already have 2-3 of and will be transplanting. 

I was hoping for suggestions on an alternative to the azaleas and lantana, and anything that fills blooming time gaps. I think early spring and late summer might be kind of light. Thanks for any help!",3,2,1.0,gardening

I'm attempting to identify plants in my yard to eradicate early before they become worse pests. I live on a mostly un-landscaped acre (I rent) in the SoCal desert on a sand lot. It's still nearly 90 here, and everything is still growing. I'm still yanking ragweed, which is literally five feet tall in my neighbors' yards. One of my dogs is allergic. Gah.

After the heavy rains of this past winter and spring, I have a lot of what looks like puncturevine that hasn't spread into those long whips. I did pull the obvious puncturevine plants, as those burrs are NASTY and constantly get in my dogs' paws and in the soles of my shoes. But I have some other plants that look just like puncturevine leaves but never grow longer -- they look almost like tiny fern-y ground cover.

At first I thought they were a different sex of the puncturevine, but then I read puncturevine is hermaphroditic.  Is it possibly another less invasive/harmful caltrop species? If they flowered, it was early in the spring before they were so abundant, so that doesn't help. I've searched and searched online and can't find the information I need.

I don't want to bother hoeing it out if it's harmless. I pretty much leave everything native in the yard for the birds and the bees if it's not hurting me or the pets.

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

Fast forward to today, I noticed the leaf spot disease wasn't fully healed, and the leaves(?) on the ripening persimmons had spots. I also noticed a couple of mealybugs near the stem of the fruitüò≠ I treated the tree again with neem oil last night but the damage is already done

Would these persimmons be safe to eat? I
sprayed 70% alcohol on the stem area where I saw a mealybug and drenched the fruits in dawn dish soap + water.

This is my current plant list. Mostly based on plants I've seen a lot of native bees and wasps on. My soil is acidic heavy clay. Whatever you imagine when you read that, it's significantly heavier clay than that. 


- Chaste tree - probably planted separately to avoid shading everything else out. Attracts lots of bees
- high bush blueberry - for the blueberry digger bees.
- goldenrod - slender and seaside varieties. 
- swamp milkweed and tuberosa milkweed - can't not include this.
- Honeycomb buddleia
- coral bells azalea for a border. I'd like to change this to something else as they don't really get much bee traffic. They are a cheap (frequently $5 per small plant after they drop blooms), neat looking, evergreen plant that will reduce the weedy look though, which is important.
- sterile lantana variety - same purpose as the azaleas. Another one that I wouldn't mind substituting, they really don't attract many insects considering the huge number of flowers - they are very easy to shape though, and they thrive in my crappy soil.

The azaleas (or their replacement), milkweeds and goldenrod, I plan to load up on. The lantana too, but to a lesser degree. Everything else will be single specimens except for the blueberries, which I already have 2-3 of and will be transplanting.

I have intention to make a garden in my balcony, it faces East. The problem is it is super windy and also dry wind (Australia). I think how about have some shelves and get some plants to cover the wind. I can't install any windbreaker so that's the only solution I can think of.

Is this a good idea? If it is, which plants are good to be the ""cover"" plants? 

Do you guys have any other tips for a windy balcony?  


Thank you <3",1,0,0.5,gardening

Normally, I just let my plants die off in the fall or bring them inside if they're small/low maintenance. This summer I bought a small strawberry bush and left it in its container. I want it to come back next year. From what I've read, it needs to die off in the cold but since it's potted it can't get too cold or else it'll die off permenantly. Some suggestions were to put it in the garage or some other place that gets cold but not too cold. I don't have any place like that. Can I wrap it in a heavy blanket and leave it outside over winter?

Are these persimmons safe to eat?,"l've have a persimmon tree in my backyard for years, but it never kept the fruit on the tree long enough to ripen (it would fall early and/or get eaten by something). For the first time in years, we've had success in having the fruits ripen enough on the tree!

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

Fast forward to today, I noticed the leaf spot disease wasn't fully healed, and the leaves(?) on the ripening persimmons had spots. I also noticed a couple of mealybugs near the stem of the fruitüò≠ I treated the tree again with neem oil last night but the damage is already done

Would these persimmons be safe to eat? I
sprayed 70% alcohol on the stem area where I saw a mealybug and drenched the fruits in dawn dish soap + water.

179o0ce,1697510236.0,Plants that resemble puncturevine leaves???,"I'll try to add a picture tomorrow when it's light if no one has any thoughts on this.

I'm attempting to identify plants in my yard to eradicate early before they become worse pests. I live on a mostly un-landscaped acre (I rent) in the SoCal desert on a sand lot. It's still nearly 90 here, and everything is still growing. I'm still yanking ragweed, which is literally five feet tall in my neighbors' yards. One of my dogs is allergic. Gah.

After the heavy rains of this past winter and spring, I have a lot of what looks like puncturevine that hasn't spread into those long whips. I did pull the obvious puncturevine plants, as those burrs are NASTY and constantly get in my dogs' paws and in the soles of my shoes. But I have some other plants that look just like puncturevine leaves but never grow longer -- they look almost like tiny fern-y ground cover.

At first I thought they were a different sex of the puncturevine, but then I read puncturevine is hermaphroditic.  Is it possibly another less invasive/harmful caltrop species? If they flowered, it was early in the spring before they were so abundant, so that doesn't help. I've searched and searched online and can't find the information I need.

I don't want to bother hoeing it out if it's harmless. I pretty much leave everything native in the yard for the birds and the bees if it's not hurting me or the pets.

TIA. :)

179f9p6,1697486720.0,Pineapples! A how-to guide to grow & care for your own :),"About 25 years ago I moved from New England, which is full of seasons, to a little peninsula in South Florida with a very tropical year-round climate‚Ä¶ which is where I discovered my love for Bromeliads and have been growing them ever since!

Pineapples are a variety of Bromeliad, I have been growing generational pineapples for many years. And while they do prefer to grow in a climate like mine, they can be grown in all other zones, as long as their needs are met, which are quite simple really. 
____
Pineapple plants are very resilient and they have simple needs: warm weather, sunshine, water, quick draining soil, & time (lots & lots of time). 

- The preferred growing zone is 11-12. 

- As far as temperature; they fruit optimally between 68-86¬∞F, anything below 60 or above 90 will still suffice, it just slows down the growth rate.

An easy solution is to grow them in pots! I do this even here so they can be easily moved around during the seasons to get shade during high-heat. If you do have frost where you are, they can grow outside in the summer and inside in the winter (just put them in your sunniest window). They have a pretty shallow root system, so the pot size can be pretty small compared to the adult plant size. 

I generally like to use the fabric grow bags for pots, because of their lightweight & great draining. 

- For water; since they are a Bromeliad, they have a built-in water tank! Which is located in the central part of the plant stem that is created by the leaves shaping into a hollow cylinder. They need to keep this constantly full of water (and is how they collect and store rain and dew naturally).  

Once the ground roots are established in soil, they do not need much water at all, overfilling the plants water tank when it‚Äôs low to allow a decent trickling into the soil is sufficient. 

- For soil; they prefer fast draining and to not have their ground roots soaking in water.

I like to use Miracle Grows ‚ÄúCactus, Palm & Citrus Potting Mix‚Äù in the orange bag. However, there are bromeliad specific soils that can be used. And make sure your pot has enough drainage holes.

- For time; this will vary significantly based on all the factors listed above and how the plant is started. Even in ideal growing conditions the time is extensive, I will list the times based on my climate (which is ideal for pineapples)

For growing from a topper; it will take 24-36 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop.

For growing from a pup or slip; it will take 12-18 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop. 

*this is why generational pineapple plants are the preferred growing method*
____
Other things to know about pineapples:

- They will not survive 28¬∞F or lower, this will destroy the entire plant and all parts. 

- The parent plant will only produce one pineapple fruit and then die. 

- The parent plant will produce pups & slips. 

- Not all pineapple plant varieties produce slips, but all will produce at least 1 pup. 

- Most parent plants will produce more pups once the previous pups have been removed. 
___
Pineapple parent plants will produce up to 4 ways to propagate future pineapple plants. 

- Toppers are the crown of the fruit itself

- Slips grow from the top of peduncle stem and base of the fruit

- Aerial pups grow from aerial roots located in between the leaves 

- Ground pups grow from the main root stem under the soil or at the very base of the plant
____
Toppers are a great way to start on your pineapple plant journey!

- Pick a fruit with vibrant green leaves to start with, the healthier your starting point = the healthier your plant

- Remove the topper from the fruit, I like to leave about 1/2 inch of the actual fruit part to use the core as part of the main stem for stability reasons

- Clean off any excess fruit with a paring knife; I like to score the fruit from the bottom first

- Clean off lower layers of leaves to expose root nodes by gently grabbing each leaf and peeling from side to side (you‚Äôll notice leaves at the base of the topper are much smaller than the ones at the top: remove all those small leaves)

Slips, if your plant produces them, should be removed pretty quickly from the fruit base, since it directly drains energy from fruit development. If you plan to propagate with them, allow them to grow at least 2‚Äù in size first. (I just quickly dispose of these when they start to happen)

- The fruit base will have its own independent leaves, so make sure to properly identify a slip, which would look like a small topper growing out

- Firmly grab and twist off while supporting the fruit and stem to prevent damage

Aerial pups are the easiest and best to use for propagating, they do not feed off of the parent plant (they will drink out of the tank water supply) and come off very easily. 

- When they are about 4-6‚Äù in size, firmly grab them and twist them right off. 

Ground pups are also very common to develop, but can be hard to see at first since they might be buried and not as easy to remove. 

- You can try to twist them off once they‚Äôre about 5-8‚Äù in size

- You can cut them off of the main root

- You can just leave them alone and once the parent plant dies off, they will take over the pot. (this is not as aesthetically pleasing)

- You can wait until the parent plant dies off, then just pull them apart and repot them directly into soil

To root all of the above future plants: the easiest way is to simply put them in a glass vessel full of water and place in a windowsill!

- Make sure the mouth of the container is smaller than the leaves, the plant will hold itself up

- Keep the water supply up to the bottom of the leaves where the root nodes live

- Remove it every few days to rinse the roots off, rinse the vessel out, and refill with fresh water to keep it healthy

- Once roots develop, plant growth is noticed, and a decent cylindrical hole is in the center of the leaves.. it can be transplanted to soil. 

- If you would like to stall their growth cycle, just continue to keep them happy & healthy in the water. I do this for a couple of reasons; to have multiple parent plants fruiting at different times and to have a back-up saved for emergencies, the longest I have stalled a pup is 18 months! (that one is the one in my photos, it‚Äôs entire family was destroyed in hurricane Ian)

- Once potted, water both the leaf tank and the soil frequently until a growth spurt happens, then you can just overfill the leaf tank. (that means the plant established itself and transfer to soil was successful)
____
I am including some photos to help give a visual for you to refer to!

- I drew & labeled parts of the parent plant for you 

- I have included photos of other bromeliads with examples of both aerial & ground pups

- There is a current pineapple plant growing with an extra photo of spikes developing on the sides of the leaves, not all varieties have them (these will tear you up! They will grow to be razor sharp! I use elbow high leather gloves to care for my pineapple plants)

- Photos of me using a very crappy store bought pineapple (it‚Äôs all they had, I‚Äôm so sorry!) as an example step by step for turning your own fruit into a plant. 

Please pick a nicer & healthier looking pineapple topper to use!!

You will notice the core in the fruit & me scoring that, removing all the fruit bits, peeling the leaves off, and the small little bumps & wiggles that are aerial root nodes (those are the parts you want to submerge in the water!)
____
Make sure that your pineapple fruit or plant is an edible variety (like from a fruit in the grocery store produce) and not an ornamental variety, if you plant to eat them. But, if you just want to grow them for looks, taking care of an ornamental or dwarf plant is the same, just on a smaller scale.

1794igq,1697458276.0,BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE," 

The frequency of adding humus and compost to your vegetable garden is determined by various factors. Generally, a recommended practice is to introduce compost once a year, either in the spring or fall. 

[BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE: A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO RECYCLE](https://lovjoyfulgarden.com/bucket-composting-at-home-small-space-a-sustainable-way-to-recycle/)

1. For vegetables that will be consumed raw, it's recommended to apply composted manure at least 60 days prior to harvest. Ideally, apply the manure in the fall to give ample time for the decomposition of any potential pathogens before planting your garden in the spring. This approach ensures the safety of your fresh produce for uncooked consumption.

2. Refrain from using cat, dog, or pig manures in your gardens or compost piles, as these may harbor parasites that can endure and pose health risks to humans.

3. Avoid applying manure once your garden is already planted.

Prior to consumption, ensure thorough washing of uncooked vegetables.

4. Individuals at heightened risk of foodborne illnesses, including pregnant women, young children, and those with underlying health conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes, or AIDS, should steer clear of consuming raw vegetables from gardens fertilized with manure.

This replenishes nutrients and enhances soil structure. For humus, consider adding it every 2-3 years to maintain organic matter content. However, the specific needs of your garden can vary, so it's advisable to perform soil tests to determine nutrient levels and adjust your application schedule accordingly. Balancing the soil's organic matter is essential for healthy and productive vegetable growth.",0,0,0.25,gardening

I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I'll try anyway.I recently took half my basil plants back inside from the balcony to save them for winter and found some caterpillars. I first thought it was two, but now I've seen 5 :D  
They really like my basil (even tho they shouldn't like it according to the internet). They seem to be **small whites/cabbage whites.**  
So to my request. I really want to save them and I read online that they survive winter in their cocoon or even as butterflies, but I am scared that the indoor heat will mess their stasis up and they will become butterflies during winter and I can't keep butterflies in my apartment :(

If anyone have recommendations as to where to safely put them outside or if they will just cocoon for those months? Any help is welcome. Thanks.

178nfms,1697399456.0,Looking for plants and flowers safe for my indoor cats.,"(Our cats are indoor only, to be precise)

We weren't sure whether to ask this on a local Montreal subreddit for the few people that might know flowers and plants or to come to a gardening subreddit that might know different regions but asking here makes more sense.

This was never an issue until our recently adopted senior boy went for our Virginia Creeper and English Ivy, lavender and other plants. Our previous cat didn't care for them at all, so ok, now we have a cat that goes for toxic plants.

So the question is, knowing that we are in Montreal (hardiness zone 5b) and that we happen to get very little direct light on our balcony or through our windows but a very good amount of non direct daylight all day because of our exposure, what flowers, plants, small trees and bushes can we have that won't kill our cats? Aesthetically, we had been going for a very traditional English garden look with our overall balcony and indoor gardening but not harming our cats is obviously a greater priority than aesthetics.

I like growing a lot of root vegetables, carrots, turnips, garlic, beets etc. 

When I planted these I had semi luck but it seemed every root vegetable I planted wasn‚Äôt deep enough. I had carrots, turnips and everything else  growing half way on top of the soil which made them very small. I ended up re planting them deeper and they did alright after that but still not great. I know it‚Äôs not a space issue bc I make sure to plant them spread out and in a pot that‚Äôs deep enough (at least 12 inches deep) 

At first I followed the depth instructions to plant the seeds on the packet, and then the second bunch I did an inch deeper and still had this issue. 

How deep should I plant root vegetables because they always seems to grow on top or halfway on top of the soil? 

TL:DR: my root vegetables keep growing on top of soil no matter how deep I plant the seed, how do I stop this so I can grow bigger and better root vegetables ?",8,2,0.75,gardening

Half the stems are yellowed and their isn‚Äôt much consistency or symmetry in growth. 

The other issue is that they‚Äôre attracting wasps. So now I have a bamboo cemetery with flying pain extractors. I was also looking for recommendations on plants (I saw natives were suitable) that aren‚Äôt toxic to dogs which attract small birds (which eat wasps). 

My neighbour told me that you should trim the stems to stimulate growth which I have now realised was incorrect. It apparently stunts the growth. Also, I‚Äôve literally only started watering them properly as I thought they were the plant version of a camel. There has been some growth since the more frequent watering. I also was putting that eco-oil on the bamboo to deter pests.

It's a mix of soil and sand for the first foot with more sand the further down you go and then it starts to turn into clay. I thought it was loamy but now I'm wondering if it isn't considered sandy.

I was already planning on building raised garden beds in one section. Should I plan to make more or if with some soil remediation can I make it healthy enough for the planting I wanted to do? The yard is easy enough to break up into sections. The raised beds will be veg. I wanted to plant some berry bushes and have a small orchard in one section. The leach field I was going to turn into a wildflower garden with a garden fence to distinguish that area. Does this sound doable or will it be a nightmare?",14,1,0.67,gardening

(Pics show degression),"Hello Earthly Caretakers, my thyme plant was under watered (going 2-4 weeks without water). I watered her, and she began to turn green and flourish as in the first pic.   

But then by the end of the week all her leaves turned yellow and brown, crinkly tipped. I was perplexed on why she was dying after going through a growth phase, and I became afraid of giving her more water. Was it still the original underwatering taking a toll? 

The 1st picture was two weeks ago when she had a drink. The 2nd picture is just this last Saturday, when she began to turn yellow and brown-tipped. She still had green, but she turned brown in the 3rd picture by Wednesday. And the 4th picture is her before pruning: very barren. The last pic is after pruning, today. 

How can I prune her to give her the best chance at regrowth? Two people have said to prune all of her branches off to give her a chance to refresh, but I‚Äôm afraid to do this. It‚Äôs hard to see in the picture, but there are tiny green buds (smaller than a gnat) on some of the branches. Should I still prune her entirely, or leave these for photosynthesis?

History: I've had her for one year in this soil. She had mold caked on the soil that I scraped off. She was put under a grow light during the week she died. 

Her name is Fasho, and when I meditate with her I feel a deep passion and social connectivity with others. She is my family member and I will try to do all that I can to give the best chance at saving her .

Hi there-
This summer I got two potted Bougainviellas that were doing great on my balcony until I went on vacation for 2 1/2 weeks. In that time my friend who was house sitting forgot to water my plants and they all dried up their leaves. After I came back, I pruned back everything to where I was seeing green in the cuts (i thought it was a good sign it's still alive in there?). But now it's October and the plants don't seem to be sprouting any more new green leaves, except for 2-3 on the one plant, and I'm worried that they're just going to die now. Plus they were ""winter hardened""
So I know they can tolerate the cold season but I'm just wondering the best way to treat the plant now going into winter. With no leaves and cooling temps, will it just go dormant till spring then come back, or is there a chance it might die in between?

177gsjw,1697255607.0,Starting Seeds During Autumn Indoors.,"Sooo this is my first year gardening and I've gotten really into growing plants from seed. I've done this completely indoors since I started gardening in April in zone 8b (Seattle area). I was afraid of starting them outdoors and it getting too hot when they're too young, so I've moved them outside throughout the summer as they've gotten big enough. I have some seedlings that I started in the middle of September that will obviously wait to go outside until after any danger of frost, with it being October. I plan to start seeds throughout fall and winter but I was curious of people's personal experiences with growing plants from seeds during this time of year. 

I guess my main question is, do seeds ""know"" it's winter, despite growlights, consitent temperature, etc? Maybe it's just a few plants in particular, but I've noticed them growing slower this last week, and my main concern is obviously the plants getting too big before winter is over. 

What are your guys' experiences with growing seeds in the winter indoors? I'm not talking about vegetables and herbs, as I stick to ornamental plants mainly. Examples of seedlings I have now are Celosia, Amaranth, Snapdragon, Scabiosa, and Lupine to name a few.

So my mom planted two amaryllis bulbs in this pot a few years back. This was soon forgotten and neglected. It had greenery and it did let out one or two flowers every now and then. It looked overcrowded, as you can see in pictures 1 and 2.

I was gonna throw it out and plant something else but thought to myself why not try to separate the bulbs for the hell of it. So I did. Turns out there were 92 bulbs of varying shapes and sizes in the pot, as seen in pictures 3-5 (picture 5 is of the smallest one I found).

I have absolutely no experience with amaryllis. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do with these? (as in like do I plant them in individual pots? Do I do something before I plant them? Again, no experience whatsoever with this) Their roots were incredibly tangled so I had to cut and rip. 

Also if anyone can tell me what those growths in pictures 6 and 7 are, would be much appreciated.",9,6,0.81,gardening

First year gardening, and outside of the abject failure of our carrots and onions, everything else was fair to call a success. Particularly, as you can see, the tomatoes. And as much as we love tomatoes, we're definitely going to need to find some folks to offload some of these.

The varieties we grew were Italian Roma, Roma VF, San Marzano, and Beefsteak. Both Roma varieties were the most vigorous and provided the most consistent harvest. San Marzano were pretty good. Beefsteak proved the most difficult, being prone to splitting and slow to grow and rippen.

We additionally grew green beans of the Harvester Bush variety, which were awesome and produced like mad...until the grasshoppers came. I have made mortal enemies of these creatures.

And, most interestingly, we had a volunteer pumpkin plant! You can look back in my post history where I sought an ID for a mystery plant that appeared in spring.

Seedling Case - Marigold Seedlings (50-70x)

Black Pot - More Holy Basil

The reason for having so many Basil plants, is that I want to have enough to produce thousands of tulsi seeds because I need it every year. But!

Cilantro are also my fast germinators, but only if wettened.

Small pots on the bottom are just transplanted marigolds and trial at having more cilantro.

I have a wild unmanaged raspberry bush in my backyard. It has remained in its place from simply mowing the grass in front of the bush. This year however it took over 3 feet of the yard. 

My questions are: 

Can I simply cut the stem/branch/whatever they are called, at ground level? 

Will this contain the bush/give me my 3 feet back?

Will the cut branch be a stepping hazard( are they strong enough to pierce a shoe?) 

How deep would I have to dig to prevent further spreading? 

My plans for next year are to trim bind and trellis them hopefully. Some are over 7 feet long and are too heavy to stand. They lay on the ground and rot.

Other pollinators too, but these are my favorite. I like to photograph them, and I just overall like seeing them. I'm trying to keep the footprint fairly small at the moment.

This is my current plant list. Mostly based on plants I've seen a lot of native bees and wasps on. My soil is acidic heavy clay. Whatever you imagine when you read that, it's significantly heavier clay than that. 


- Chaste tree - probably planted separately to avoid shading everything else out. Attracts lots of bees
- high bush blueberry - for the blueberry digger bees.
- goldenrod - slender and seaside varieties. 
- swamp milkweed and tuberosa milkweed - can't not include this.
- Honeycomb buddleia
- coral bells azalea for a border. I'd like to change this to something else as they don't really get much bee traffic. They are a cheap (frequently $5 per small plant after they drop blooms), neat looking, evergreen plant that will reduce the weedy look though, which is important.
- sterile lantana variety - same purpose as the azaleas. Another one that I wouldn't mind substituting, they really don't attract many insects considering the huge number of flowers - they are very easy to shape though, and they thrive in my crappy soil.

The azaleas (or their replacement), milkweeds and goldenrod, I plan to load up on. The lantana too, but to a lesser degree. Everything else will be single specimens except for the blueberries, which I already have 2-3 of and will be transplanting. 

I was hoping for suggestions on an alternative to the azaleas and lantana, and anything that fills blooming time gaps. I think early spring and late summer might be kind of light. Thanks for any help!",3,2,1.0,gardening

179o0ce,1697510236.0,Plants that resemble puncturevine leaves???,"I'll try to add a picture tomorrow when it's light if no one has any thoughts on this.

I'm attempting to identify plants in my yard to eradicate early before they become worse pests. I live on a mostly un-landscaped acre (I rent) in the SoCal desert on a sand lot. It's still nearly 90 here, and everything is still growing. I'm still yanking ragweed, which is literally five feet tall in my neighbors' yards. One of my dogs is allergic. Gah.

After the heavy rains of this past winter and spring, I have a lot of what looks like puncturevine that hasn't spread into those long whips. I did pull the obvious puncturevine plants, as those burrs are NASTY and constantly get in my dogs' paws and in the soles of my shoes. But I have some other plants that look just like puncturevine leaves but never grow longer -- they look almost like tiny fern-y ground cover.

At first I thought they were a different sex of the puncturevine, but then I read puncturevine is hermaphroditic.  Is it possibly another less invasive/harmful caltrop species? If they flowered, it was early in the spring before they were so abundant, so that doesn't help. I've searched and searched online and can't find the information I need.

I don't want to bother hoeing it out if it's harmless. I pretty much leave everything native in the yard for the birds and the bees if it's not hurting me or the pets.

TIA. :)

Are these persimmons safe to eat?,"l've have a persimmon tree in my backyard for years, but it never kept the fruit on the tree long enough to ripen (it would fall early and/or get eaten by something). For the first time in years, we've had success in having the fruits ripen enough on the tree!

I've only recently started my plant care journey, and nobody else in my family has a green thumb or interest in plant care, so the persimmon tree had been neglected besides the occasional watering from the sprinklers and pruning from the gardeners.

Months ago, I noticed leaf spot disease(?) on the leaves of the tree, so I heavily pruned the diseased leaves and treated it with neem oil a couple of times. I then forgot about it for weeks I thought it was healed because the tree was producing nice fruits and they weren't dropping
early (a sign of leaf spot disease apparently?). I don't go out to the backyard often.

179f9p6,1697486720.0,Pineapples! A how-to guide to grow & care for your own :),"About 25 years ago I moved from New England, which is full of seasons, to a little peninsula in South Florida with a very tropical year-round climate‚Ä¶ which is where I discovered my love for Bromeliads and have been growing them ever since!

Pineapples are a variety of Bromeliad, I have been growing generational pineapples for many years. And while they do prefer to grow in a climate like mine, they can be grown in all other zones, as long as their needs are met, which are quite simple really. 
____
Pineapple plants are very resilient and they have simple needs: warm weather, sunshine, water, quick draining soil, & time (lots & lots of time). 

- The preferred growing zone is 11-12. 

- As far as temperature; they fruit optimally between 68-86¬∞F, anything below 60 or above 90 will still suffice, it just slows down the growth rate.

An easy solution is to grow them in pots! I do this even here so they can be easily moved around during the seasons to get shade during high-heat. If you do have frost where you are, they can grow outside in the summer and inside in the winter (just put them in your sunniest window). They have a pretty shallow root system, so the pot size can be pretty small compared to the adult plant size. 

I generally like to use the fabric grow bags for pots, because of their lightweight & great draining. 

- For water; since they are a Bromeliad, they have a built-in water tank! Which is located in the central part of the plant stem that is created by the leaves shaping into a hollow cylinder. They need to keep this constantly full of water (and is how they collect and store rain and dew naturally).  

Once the ground roots are established in soil, they do not need much water at all, overfilling the plants water tank when it‚Äôs low to allow a decent trickling into the soil is sufficient. 

- For soil; they prefer fast draining and to not have their ground roots soaking in water.

I like to use Miracle Grows ‚ÄúCactus, Palm & Citrus Potting Mix‚Äù in the orange bag. However, there are bromeliad specific soils that can be used. And make sure your pot has enough drainage holes.

- For time; this will vary significantly based on all the factors listed above and how the plant is started. Even in ideal growing conditions the time is extensive, I will list the times based on my climate (which is ideal for pineapples)

For growing from a topper; it will take 24-36 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop.

For growing from a pup or slip; it will take 12-18 months for the plant to mature and flower, then another 6 months for the fruit to develop. 

*this is why generational pineapple plants are the preferred growing method*
____
Other things to know about pineapples:

- They will not survive 28¬∞F or lower, this will destroy the entire plant and all parts. 

- The parent plant will only produce one pineapple fruit and then die. 

- The parent plant will produce pups & slips. 

- Not all pineapple plant varieties produce slips, but all will produce at least 1 pup. 

- Most parent plants will produce more pups once the previous pups have been removed. 
___
Pineapple parent plants will produce up to 4 ways to propagate future pineapple plants. 

- Toppers are the crown of the fruit itself

- Slips grow from the top of peduncle stem and base of the fruit

- Aerial pups grow from aerial roots located in between the leaves 

- Ground pups grow from the main root stem under the soil or at the very base of the plant
____
Toppers are a great way to start on your pineapple plant journey!

- Pick a fruit with vibrant green leaves to start with, the healthier your starting point = the healthier your plant

- Remove the topper from the fruit, I like to leave about 1/2 inch of the actual fruit part to use the core as part of the main stem for stability reasons

- Clean off any excess fruit with a paring knife; I like to score the fruit from the bottom first

- Clean off lower layers of leaves to expose root nodes by gently grabbing each leaf and peeling from side to side (you‚Äôll notice leaves at the base of the topper are much smaller than the ones at the top: remove all those small leaves)

Slips, if your plant produces them, should be removed pretty quickly from the fruit base, since it directly drains energy from fruit development. If you plan to propagate with them, allow them to grow at least 2‚Äù in size first. (I just quickly dispose of these when they start to happen)

- The fruit base will have its own independent leaves, so make sure to properly identify a slip, which would look like a small topper growing out

- Firmly grab and twist off while supporting the fruit and stem to prevent damage

Aerial pups are the easiest and best to use for propagating, they do not feed off of the parent plant (they will drink out of the tank water supply) and come off very easily. 

- When they are about 4-6‚Äù in size, firmly grab them and twist them right off. 

Ground pups are also very common to develop, but can be hard to see at first since they might be buried and not as easy to remove. 

- You can try to twist them off once they‚Äôre about 5-8‚Äù in size

- You can cut them off of the main root

- You can just leave them alone and once the parent plant dies off, they will take over the pot. (this is not as aesthetically pleasing)

- You can wait until the parent plant dies off, then just pull them apart and repot them directly into soil

To root all of the above future plants: the easiest way is to simply put them in a glass vessel full of water and place in a windowsill!

- Make sure the mouth of the container is smaller than the leaves, the plant will hold itself up

- Keep the water supply up to the bottom of the leaves where the root nodes live

- Remove it every few days to rinse the roots off, rinse the vessel out, and refill with fresh water to keep it healthy

- Once roots develop, plant growth is noticed, and a decent cylindrical hole is in the center of the leaves.. it can be transplanted to soil. 

- If you would like to stall their growth cycle, just continue to keep them happy & healthy in the water. I do this for a couple of reasons; to have multiple parent plants fruiting at different times and to have a back-up saved for emergencies, the longest I have stalled a pup is 18 months! (that one is the one in my photos, it‚Äôs entire family was destroyed in hurricane Ian)

- Once potted, water both the leaf tank and the soil frequently until a growth spurt happens, then you can just overfill the leaf tank. (that means the plant established itself and transfer to soil was successful)
____
I am including some photos to help give a visual for you to refer to!

- I drew & labeled parts of the parent plant for you 

- I have included photos of other bromeliads with examples of both aerial & ground pups

- There is a current pineapple plant growing with an extra photo of spikes developing on the sides of the leaves, not all varieties have them (these will tear you up! They will grow to be razor sharp! I use elbow high leather gloves to care for my pineapple plants)

- Photos of me using a very crappy store bought pineapple (it‚Äôs all they had, I‚Äôm so sorry!) as an example step by step for turning your own fruit into a plant. 

Please pick a nicer & healthier looking pineapple topper to use!!

You will notice the core in the fruit & me scoring that, removing all the fruit bits, peeling the leaves off, and the small little bumps & wiggles that are aerial root nodes (those are the parts you want to submerge in the water!)
____
Make sure that your pineapple fruit or plant is an edible variety (like from a fruit in the grocery store produce) and not an ornamental variety, if you plant to eat them. But, if you just want to grow them for looks, taking care of an ornamental or dwarf plant is the same, just on a smaller scale. 

Good Luck to you on your pineapple journey! :)",0,1,0.67,gardening

1794igq,1697458276.0,BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE," 

The frequency of adding humus and compost to your vegetable garden is determined by various factors. Generally, a recommended practice is to introduce compost once a year, either in the spring or fall. 

[BUCKET COMPOSTING AT HOME SMALL-SPACE: A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO RECYCLE](https://lovjoyfulgarden.com/bucket-composting-at-home-small-space-a-sustainable-way-to-recycle/)

1. For vegetables that will be consumed raw, it's recommended to apply composted manure at least 60 days prior to harvest. Ideally, apply the manure in the fall to give ample time for the decomposition of any potential pathogens before planting your garden in the spring. This approach ensures the safety of your fresh produce for uncooked consumption.

2. Refrain from using cat, dog, or pig manures in your gardens or compost piles, as these may harbor parasites that can endure and pose health risks to humans.

3. Avoid applying manure once your garden is already planted.

Prior to consumption, ensure thorough washing of uncooked vegetables.

4. Individuals at heightened risk of foodborne illnesses, including pregnant women, young children, and those with underlying health conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes, or AIDS, should steer clear of consuming raw vegetables from gardens fertilized with manure.

This replenishes nutrients and enhances soil structure. For humus, consider adding it every 2-3 years to maintain organic matter content. However, the specific needs of your garden can vary, so it's advisable to perform soil tests to determine nutrient levels and adjust your application schedule accordingly. Balancing the soil's organic matter is essential for healthy and productive vegetable growth.",0,0,0.25,gardening

There have always been 2-3 Indian Chamaleons (Girgit) on my plants but recently this rainy season I found few eggs inside one of my pot under the soil. At that time I did nothing because I wanted to see what kind of eggs were these and which animal would pop out of these but I had a doubt about those being Chamaleon eggs. Now after 2 months there are lots of Chamaleons on my plants. There are so many of them that I am having problem in watering the plants because the bigger once (might be parent chamaleon) are trying to defend their territory by charging on me trying to attack. There are so many of small and big once everywhere on my roof now and I want to get rid of them. 
Previously when there were few chamaleon I used to scare them away by water splashing from which they would get to the neighbouring roofs and eventually used to come back. But now I can not do it with so many of them. I know I should have removed the eggs in the first place when I found them but now they have become a big problem. They are a threat to my plants and family now.

I'm also wondering if hard water from the tap (I'm in central Austin Texas, if that helps at all) is okay for plants, since some seem to get brown bits on them when I use it. I could buy a filter, but all the options I've found require some sort of power source to ""monitor the quality of the filter"" and you can't replace the battery because of course you can't (really it just tells you to replace the filter after you turn the sensor upside down enough times when pouring, a bit lousy really).

178nfms,1697399456.0,Looking for plants and flowers safe for my indoor cats.,"(Our cats are indoor only, to be precise)

We weren't sure whether to ask this on a local Montreal subreddit for the few people that might know flowers and plants or to come to a gardening subreddit that might know different regions but asking here makes more sense.

This was never an issue until our recently adopted senior boy went for our Virginia Creeper and English Ivy, lavender and other plants. Our previous cat didn't care for them at all, so ok, now we have a cat that goes for toxic plants.

So the question is, knowing that we are in Montreal (hardiness zone 5b) and that we happen to get very little direct light on our balcony or through our windows but a very good amount of non direct daylight all day because of our exposure, what flowers, plants, small trees and bushes can we have that won't kill our cats? Aesthetically, we had been going for a very traditional English garden look with our overall balcony and indoor gardening but not harming our cats is obviously a greater priority than aesthetics.

I like growing a lot of root vegetables, carrots, turnips, garlic, beets etc. 

When I planted these I had semi luck but it seemed every root vegetable I planted wasn‚Äôt deep enough. I had carrots, turnips and everything else  growing half way on top of the soil which made them very small. I ended up re planting them deeper and they did alright after that but still not great. I know it‚Äôs not a space issue bc I make sure to plant them spread out and in a pot that‚Äôs deep enough (at least 12 inches deep) 

At first I followed the depth instructions to plant the seeds on the packet, and then the second bunch I did an inch deeper and still had this issue. 

How deep should I plant root vegetables because they always seems to grow on top or halfway on top of the soil?

I would really like to grow a plant but I have really low patience and I know gardening or planting a tree requires a lot of it .I would like to see visible results.

So, the question is ""what should I plant, something that wouldn't take an eternity to grow"" also if the options include stuff that grows flowers and fruits I would love to grow that. 

I want to know all the suggestions and pls be kind and forgive me If I said anything wrong. I know noting about planting and gardening whatsoever.   ",4,1,0.67,gardening

1786z79,1697342132.0,Bamboo Is Not Growing,"I‚Äôve planted the bamboo you see in the picture approximately 2.5-3 years ago. The person we bought it off said it can only grow to 4 metres and that it is a one of the slower growing types. The bamboo is filled with moulded areas where the leaves meet the stem. Half the stems are yellowed and their isn‚Äôt much consistency or symmetry in growth. 

The other issue is that they‚Äôre attracting wasps. So now I have a bamboo cemetery with flying pain extractors. I was also looking for recommendations on plants (I saw natives were suitable) that aren‚Äôt toxic to dogs which attract small birds (which eat wasps). 

My neighbour told me that you should trim the stems to stimulate growth which I have now realised was incorrect. It apparently stunts the growth. Also, I‚Äôve literally only started watering them properly as I thought they were the plant version of a camel. There has been some growth since the more frequent watering. I also was putting that eco-oil on the bamboo to deter pests. 

The point I‚Äôm getting at, is it now almost impossible to birth these things back to health or should I rip them out and start again? The soil in my area sucks too, it‚Äôs half clay. I‚Äôve just had this sudden realisation that there‚Äôs a large purple elephant in my backyard that I haven‚Äôt even noticed. We haven‚Äôt got a big backyard so I‚Äôm trying to make it as nice as I possibly can and create some form of habitat for the birds too.

But then by the end of the week all her leaves turned yellow and brown, crinkly tipped. I was perplexed on why she was dying after going through a growth phase, and I became afraid of giving her more water. Was it still the original underwatering taking a toll? 

The 1st picture was two weeks ago when she had a drink. The 2nd picture is just this last Saturday, when she began to turn yellow and brown-tipped. She still had green, but she turned brown in the 3rd picture by Wednesday. And the 4th picture is her before pruning: very barren. The last pic is after pruning, today. 

How can I prune her to give her the best chance at regrowth? Two people have said to prune all of her branches off to give her a chance to refresh, but I‚Äôm afraid to do this. It‚Äôs hard to see in the picture, but there are tiny green buds (smaller than a gnat) on some of the branches. Should I still prune her entirely, or leave these for photosynthesis?

Hi there-
This summer I got two potted Bougainviellas that were doing great on my balcony until I went on vacation for 2 1/2 weeks. In that time my friend who was house sitting forgot to water my plants and they all dried up their leaves. After I came back, I pruned back everything to where I was seeing green in the cuts (i thought it was a good sign it's still alive in there?). But now it's October and the plants don't seem to be sprouting any more new green leaves, except for 2-3 on the one plant, and I'm worried that they're just going to die now. Plus they were ""winter hardened""
So I know they can tolerate the cold season but I'm just wondering the best way to treat the plant now going into winter. With no leaves and cooling temps, will it just go dormant till spring then come back, or is there a chance it might die in between?

177gsjw,1697255607.0,Starting Seeds During Autumn Indoors.,"Sooo this is my first year gardening and I've gotten really into growing plants from seed. I've done this completely indoors since I started gardening in April in zone 8b (Seattle area). I was afraid of starting them outdoors and it getting too hot when they're too young, so I've moved them outside throughout the summer as they've gotten big enough. I have some seedlings that I started in the middle of September that will obviously wait to go outside until after any danger of frost, with it being October. I plan to start seeds throughout fall and winter but I was curious of people's personal experiences with growing plants from seeds during this time of year. 

I guess my main question is, do seeds ""know"" it's winter, despite growlights, consitent temperature, etc? Maybe it's just a few plants in particular, but I've noticed them growing slower this last week, and my main concern is obviously the plants getting too big before winter is over. 

What are your guys' experiences with growing seeds in the winter indoors? I'm not talking about vegetables and herbs, as I stick to ornamental plants mainly. Examples of seedlings I have now are Celosia, Amaranth, Snapdragon, Scabiosa, and Lupine to name a few.

I watered her, and [she began to turn green and flourish](https://imgur.com/gallery/hGM5LQM), but then by the end of the week all her leaves turned yellow and brown, crinkly tipped. I was afraid I overwatered her. I didn‚Äôt understand why she turned yellow, but by the end of the second week since watering she turned brown.

The first picture is just this past Saturday, but then she turned brown in the second picture by Wednesday. And the third picture is her before pruning. The last pic is after pruning, today. 

How can I prune her to give her the best chance at regrowth? Two people have said to prune all of her branches off to give her a chance to refresh, but I‚Äôm afraid to do this. It‚Äôs hard to see in the picture, but there are tiny green buds (smaller than a gnat) on some of the branches. Should I still prune her entirely, or leave these for photosynthesis?

History: I've had her for one year in this soil. She had mold caked on the soil that I scraped off. She was put under a grow light during the week she died. 

Her name is Fasho, and when I meditate with her I feel a deep passion and social connectivity with others. She is my family member and I will try to do all that I can to give the best chance at saving her .

4. Useable.

1. Sun damage could be avoided by hilling the plants better during the summer, so that's my fault.

2. Started herb garden (mint, tusli, lemongrass, curry leaves, chives)
3. Have planted 3 pots of spring onions, they grow so fast! (I use these a lot, so it's good to have hoke grown)
4. My last rubber plant died, so  I got a new one last month. I have been taking really good care of it, after lots of research, the baby is thriving.
5. I learned how to make home made neem water as organic pesticides, and it's working so well.
6. I found earthworms in a nursery, so got some to add to outdoor soil. I added a layer of mulch to it, food for the worms. Hopefully after 90 days I shall have my very own vermi compost
7. I planted 6 asiatic lilies, the bulbs grew into tall plants within 19 days, waiting for them to blossom. 
8. I have 4 huge aloe plants that I plan on using for skincare and haircare.

176ay6a,1697127794.0,Raised bed sub layer sand - what to do advice needed,"Hey gardening folks,
So my partner and I have been ramping up our garden and plan to add 4 more 4ft x 8ft 12"" deep raised beds next year. Our current 2 I placed on lawn soil that I turned over before filling with new compost soil, and they worked out decently  though we had a lot of rain and I think there was too much organic matter to drain well in the early months.
For the new ones where we want to place them is somewhat unique. My property had an above ground pool when I moved in that I removed immediately. Underneath is a base layer of sand (possibly on top of gravel also possibly with a plastic liner) approx 25ft diameter. This is hands down the sunniest spot of our yard, so it is where we plan to put the new beds. The sand is fairly hard packed, but drains pretty well as you would imagine sand would, it is at least 18-24 inches of sand and might have gravel beneath but I actually didn't dig any up when I dug in for the depth check, so it might just be 2 ft of sand on native soil. Native soil is fairly sandy as we are in a river delta. My goal for the beds is a sandy loam to grow mostly cucurbits in, and it will be drip irrigated for when rain isn't sufficient. I dont think there is a hard pan going on.
So specifically, short of digging up and replacing 128-256 cubic feet of sand by hand, what can I do to be sure these new beds drain properly? 
I figure in the least I will break up the sand some down to 12-18"" so it isn't as hard packed. I also considered driving small 1"" x 4ft softwood stakes through the sand that sit somewhat flush with the bottom of the raised bed every 2sqft. My thought here is that it will guarantee a hole through to subsoil for water to drain in case there is a plastic liner or gravel, and over time will decompose but remain a drainage channel.

I heard that it's normal for them to have an onion-y smell considering, well, they are onions, but it almost smells like rot and the roots are mushy as well, with even the roots in the centre turning a purple-ish black colour. that can't be right, right? I've tried trimming off the purple roots but it still stinks.

1766au5,1697115260.0,Perplexed: how can I create the most hope for a dying family member Thyme plant? (Pics in description),"She was underwatered (3-4 weeks without) still with green and some leaves falling off. [Then I gave her a drink, and she flourished (pics)!](https://imgur.com/gallery/hGM5LQM) Here are pics with new buds and green along every part of the stem for about 1 week. Towards the end of that week her [leaves began turning yellow and brown, crinkly tipped (pics).](https://imgur.com/gallery/rhyukYX) I was perplexed, since she just had a drink a week ago. It was only 4 days ago that she had green and yellow on her. Towards the second week after the drink they all fell off and [now she looks barren (pics).](https://imgur.com/gallery/sMtpjUt)  

If the original underwatering was still taking her toll, why did she go through a green growth phase? Why did she turn yellow and brown only a week after receiving water?

I learned thyme is drought tolerant and to err on less water. I was afraid somehow the soil was retaining too much moisture (even though it had that soil for a year w/o problems), so I didn‚Äôt water it again for two weeks. 

Factors: There is a chance I put her outside and the water evaporated, but I am uncertain if I did this. I also put her under a grow light for that week. She also had mold caked onto the soil that I removed.  

What can I do to give her hope? 

I‚Äôve pruned her a bit already, and it‚Äôs been 4 days since she‚Äôs been barren. How can I prune her more to make for the highest chance of survival and new growth?

I named her Fa Sho, meaning ‚ÄòCompassionate Touch‚Äù, and I hope she can be saved even if it means careful pruning. 

I believe the presence of the plants transforms our minds, like a seed that grows forever, and I hope we can make her healthy again to give to the world.",6,1,0.67,gardening

Any thoughts on what the animal might be (just out of curiousity), or solutions?

My hypothesis is that crows are getting to it, despite the netting (the netting is not very tight, will pretty easily bend to touch the soil if i apply enough weight, which is what I will attempt next if no one has any other suggestions)

Would be interesting if there are some weird soil watering physics or underground animal that could be the cause of this?

175ngh1,1697054706.0,"Passionfruit help ‚Äî care, plant ID, when to pick","I‚Äôm a complete novice/know-nothing as a gardener so I apologize in advance for the blizzard of uninformed questions/info, but a passionfruit plant I planted years ago in my Los Angeles garden has suddenly started fruiting and I‚Äôm eager for any and all advice about how to nurture it and to learn best how to harvest the fruit and, if possible, keep it fruiting in future seasons.

Background: I bought a house in LA six years ago and the house came with a few rows of drought resistant landscaping out front‚Äî rosemary, succulents, a fruiting loquat tree, Bougainville‚Äî and I kept on the house‚Äôs once a month gardener who speaks no English. (I speak very little Spanish.) Six years ago I bought a passionfruit plant at a farmers market and planted at the front row of my garden, followed the care instructions (which I‚Äôve since forgotten) for a while and gave up over time when it seemed to be dying and wasn‚Äôt producing any fruit. 

A few years ago I noticed the plant had survived, grown sideways, and seemed to be over growing/strangling a flowering thorny bush at the corner of my garden fence. Still no fruit, and I assumed there never would be.

Fast forward to yesterday when my new next door neighbor informs me they are soon going to be aggressively trimming the bush as it is growing over the corner of my fence onto their property. I said of course, but that‚Äôs when noticed the invading passionfruit vines were finally fruiting! Somewhere between ten and fifteen green passionfruits, most on my side or the street side of the fence, about a third growing onto my neighbor‚Äôs side.

I‚Äôm delighted by this surprise. Not sure ‚Äúwhy now‚Äù except perhaps the unusually rainy year gave the plant what it needed to produce. 

I would like to save the plant and start actually tending to it so it can produce for years to come, but as you can see from the photos it‚Äôs all mixed up and entangled with the corner plant and I don‚Äôt know the first thing about how to separate them or care for them beyond what my gardener does on a monthly basis. I don‚Äôt even know the name of the plant it has overtaken, or when best to pluck the fruit‚Ä¶ is it green passionfruit or do I need to wait until it darkens? It feels moderately ‚Äúfull‚Äù to the touch but I have no idea how full they are‚Ä¶ or if they‚Äôve been sufficiently watered to be juicy/edible. I also intend to let my neighbor trim what they need to, but wonder if there is any kind of collaboration/intervention I could arrange to steer the plant back my way‚Ä¶ though I understand my gardening failures may mean it‚Äôs too late.

Again, I apologize for the infodump. I appreciate any feedback, insights, guesses, or advice! Thank you.",3,2,1.0,gardening
