Don't believe your eyes!,"Currently at the top of r/houseplants is a post about a beautiful embroidered monstera patch, sat at nearly 17k upvotes, with the OP in the comments discussing how they used a machine to create this ""physical"" patch.

Someone pointed out that the image looked suspicious so I did a quick search on Midjourney (an AI image generator) and found the source of the image. This is a tool in which you can feed it text or images and it will spit out a completely new image for you, in this case ""embroidered monstera plant patch, hand-stitched nature leaves colorful"" created the image that was posted. (You can see the batch of AI generated images [here](https://i.imgur.com/yBfEi2b.jpeg))

I don't care to come after the OP with this post, each to their own. But I just thought it's a pretty good opportunity to shine some light on the impacts of this new technology. As we're living through a time where it's becoming harder and harder to spot the difference between fake and reality it's important to remember to stay alert.

It's only an embroidery patch at the end of the day, but as all these cool new AI technologies are emerging the scope and ease of misuse increases.",431,7304,0.97,houseplants

zoy5pa,1671368595.0,The top post of this subreddit at the moment (embroidered monstera patch) is AI generated. Don't believe your eyes!,"Currently at the top of r/houseplants is a post about a beautiful embroidered monstera patch, sat at nearly 17k upvotes, with the OP in the comments discussing how they used a machine to create this ""physical"" patch.

Someone pointed out that the image looked suspicious so I did a quick search on Midjourney (an AI image generator) and found the source of the image. This is a tool in which you can feed it text or images and it will spit out a completely new image for you, in this case ""embroidered monstera plant patch, hand-stitched nature leaves colorful"" created the image that was posted. (You can see the batch of AI generated images [here](https://i.imgur.com/yBfEi2b.jpeg))

I don't care to come after the OP with this post, each to their own. But I just thought it's a pretty good opportunity to shine some light on the impacts of this new technology. As we're living through a time where it's becoming harder and harder to spot the difference between fake and reality it's important to remember to stay alert.

It's only an embroidery patch at the end of the day, but as all these cool new AI technologies are emerging the scope and ease of misuse increases.",431,7312,0.97,houseplants

z2h7bb,1669183701.0,Can we not delete any posts and comments saying “wandering j*w”???,"This is the second time I am posting this. The first time I posted was deleted because I didn’t censor the god-forbidden “Wandering J-“. So i copy and pasted it and just replaced all the e’s in that word with dashes so it doesn’t get auto deleted. Please keep in mind that I do not want to do this though.

Edit: to clarify, I am not saying something along the lines of “these sjw millennials are taking away my free speech!” In fact I am usually on the side of said “sjw millenials”. But this is a different situation, and sometimes different situations are different situations. 

Edit 2: I am also not saying that you should completely abstain fro saying “wandering dude” or one of its variations. I understand that there are still Jews who find the term offensive, and I respect them. But deleting the comments of Jews who aren’t offended by it and say the word is deleting Jewish voices.

I am a Jew, and I am not claiming to speak for any other Jews other than myself. I so often see a well-meaning person call their tradescantia plant a “wandering j-w”, followed by someone in the comments saying how “wandering j-w is in fact derogatory, and we call them Wandering Dudes now ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️” Then a discussion ensues about whether or not “wandering j-w” is in fact derogatory. 

In my opinion, calling it a “wandering j-w” is the least of my worries as far as antisemitism in this world goes. Hell, my family is scared to even go inside my synagogue. But the name “Wandering J-w” is not the reason for that. The truth is, the word “jew” is like the word “queer”, in that whether or not it’s derogatory depends on the context. Wanna know what that context is? It’s really simple actually. Ask yourself “Am I being a racist shithead right now?” If your answer is no, then congratulations you did not just say a slur. A well-meaning person calling their plant a wandering j-w? Not racist. A person saying wandering j-w? Not racist. A Jewish person saying wandering j-w in a discussion about whether or not it’s racist? Also not racist. But what is racist is censoring and deleting any mentioning of the word “wandering j-w”. I absolutely hate it when people pussyfoot around saying the word “jew”. It’s not antisemitic in the context you’re probably using it in. I especially hate it when people censor it as if it’s a slur. I’m sorry but “J*w” doesn’t feel like you’re trying to be respectful by censoring a slur, it feels like you’re erasing Jews. And of course Jews are the only ones comfortable saying “jew” in these discussions, so their comments are the ones that get automatically deleted. These discussions are important, and if we want to have actual discussions about this and hear voices of all people in these discussions, you can’t just delete and vilify anyone who says “jew”.",1107,4302,0.83,houseplants

Trying to see if my feelings are irrational.


Edit: ok, you are all amazing and I so appreciate y’all for making me feel like I’m not crazy for being frustrated. 

My department chair has been notified and we are looking into getting my lock changed. There are a handful of people with master keys, but I don’t know who they are. There are things way more valuable than plants in my office, so that’s pretty concerning. 

I went hunting and found it in a big jar of water in a communal workspace of the building next door. I love my plants and enjoy taking photos of them, so I had those to compare and confirm it was mine. 

I took it, the momma plant home, and the rest of my plants home. It’s a damn shame.

1732sjt,1696781017.0,Unpopular Opinion: Just use some pesticides for indoor plants.,"I am a treehugger, I care for the bees, my garden is free of pesticides, I enjoy strategic planting of crops to counteract pests.

But for indoor plants:
Just use some flippin pesticides, my guys.

Seriously. I feel like houseplantkeeping online is very much a ""neem oil and three dashes of cinnamon will cure anything"" environment and it's just not working most of the time and doing more harm for people who have subpar growing conditions inside, be it light, temperature or water. Especially to people who are not living in a tropical climate where plants thrive anyway. 

These plants are never going to be a part of an ecosystem. These plants are never going to be eaten by a snail, which gets eaten by a lizard, which gets eaten by a bird, which gets eaten by a cat. There is no biomagnification on your bathroom shelf.

Spare yourself the headache. Just buy a pesticide spray for the aphids and be done with it. Still, be smart with it. 
Except nematodes. Nematodes actually work. Get them for your gnat infestation. Peace. ✌️",460,1433,0.9,houseplants

But for indoor plants:
Just use some flippin pesticides, my guys.

Seriously. I feel like houseplantkeeping online is very much a ""neem oil and three dashes of cinnamon will cure anything"" environment and it's just not working most of the time and doing more harm for people who have subpar growing conditions inside, be it light, temperature or water. Especially to people who are not living in a tropical climate where plants thrive anyway. 

These plants are never going to be a part of an ecosystem. These plants are never going to be eaten by a snail, which gets eaten by a lizard, which gets eaten by a bird, which gets eaten by a cat. There is no biomagnification on your bathroom shelf.

Spare yourself the headache. Just buy a pesticide spray for the aphids and be done with it. Still, be smart with it.

16zjyq2,1696416682.0,Houseplant Justice,"In but a few hours, I will storm into a courtroom with the fury of a thousand grow lights to demand that my client's collection of 30 year old houseplants be returned to her.

I represent indigent people charged with criminal offenses. Every day I fight to protect constitutional rights by holding the government to its burden. A big part of the job is to listen, work to understand, and tell my clients' stories to show the Assistant District Attorney there is more to the situation than what's in the paperwork.

Here, we have my client with her sister staying with her. There is an argument. The police arrive. It's technically DV because they're related and live together. Someone has to be arrested. My client is taken away. An automatic no contact order is imposed. My client cannot go back to her home until the case is resolved. A mutual 3rd party goes to collect clothes and other personal possessions for my client a few days later. The 8 mature houseplants my client inherited a decade ago are gone. 

My client glossed over this in our conversation. These are most valuable possessions to her name, in both a sentimental and probably monetary sense. She thought I wouldn't care - that I wouldn't take her seriously - if she started talking about the 4 foot tall jade tree or 20 year old Christmas cactus she's been nurturing for years. She had almost not mentioned it. I swear I could feel the plants inked under my shirt and tie smoldering with outrage.

I'm not sure how the case will shake out (the allegations like nonsense tbh) or that I'll be able to get the plants back. But at the very least know that, in some courtroom in some city, a very serious lawyer will be arguing with a DA about houseplants and justice.

Update: 
You're all fantastic. I'm extremely grateful for a community who understands. It's a privilege to be able to do what I do.

Before court, my client provided more information that the plants were sold, suggesting there is a specific person who has them. This was a bit of a relief - client had feared she threw them away. I conferred with the ADA before going on record to express that I would be making an absolutely serious argument about plants. When the case was called, I gave context on the number, type, and value of the plants. I also explained there is someone the complainant sold them to, so there must be contact information. I requested that the court to order the state to assist with determining who the buyer is. 

The Judge was confused at first but then it clicked and she ordered that they do everything they can to assist. I honestly think it helped that the Judge is my neighbor and cannot miss the hanging forest through my windows every day.

The DA was left without much to say (though getting them to actually do anything is another challenge). I will simply hound them until it becomes more work to ignore me than not. I am also going to have an investigator from my office try to find out work on it independently.

It was a general success that changed the focus of a pretrial appearance away from the allegations against my client to allegations against the complainant.",40,543,0.97,houseplants

For instance, I was scrolling today in the morning and noticed about 3 creators charging $10 for a 20 minute video that shows you how to make their DIY soil mix. Another one was, ""Learn how to make the best soiless potting mix!"" and from what I could see on their videos, it was just coco coir, orchid bark, leca, and perlite. And I'm not referring to them selling you their mix, they're just showing you lol.

I remember I also came across someone who was charging $4 for a 10 minute video that ranked the best fertilizer? Another one that was $3 to tell you what the best prop media is?!? Like whaaat? I remember there was a plant influencer that ended up making a program that supposedly had all of their knowledge from the past 5 years, in depth videos, and 1 on 1 support, and she charged $350. 

$4-$10 isn't a lot, but like, why do they charge for the most basic knowledge? I feel like it takes advantage of those who are starting to dip their toes into the hobby.

It was actually two tissue culture grown plants in one pot, so I split them and put them in some aroid mix and bam; 2 ppp for $10 a piece. I assume they were tissue culture, as they split easily and I did not find an obvious node/cutting in the soil when I separated them. 

A year ago that same plant would have cost easily $200, probably more. The same could be said for some of the monstera variegates. 

And so my question is; how can we know if a plant is going to come into a more affordable price range anytime in the near future? Is it simply a guessing game in regards to what plants are currently in the process of tissue culture?

16rr75j,1695646292.0,Hypothetical “free” plant…am I crazy?,"**Edit: it seems like the consensus is to directly ask the building management “Can I have one of the plants/trees, since it is going to die anyway?” I am going to do that today. Thank you all for the input!**

Here’s the situation: I live in a large building in the upper mid-Atlantic US. Every late spring/early summer, around Memorial Day, a landscaping company comes around and does work on the courtyard and planting beds. But every year for the last 4 years, they plant two dwarf fiddle leafs in raised/built-in beds outside the building.

Now, these trees thrive all summer in the shaded courtyard and humidity. But every single year, like clockwork (obviously bc they’re tropical plants), when October rolls around and we start getting nights in the 40s, they shrivel up and dry out and die. Every year, without fail. I have watched this happen every year for the last 4 years we’ve lived in the building.

Now here’s my question. I have watched these trees thrive this summer. We had a hot, humid summer, and each tree probably put out 15-20 new leaves and grew a foot over the last 4 months. I want to dig at least one up, pot it, and move it into my place for winter (and ostensibly beyond).

Our building/property manager is pretty apathetic. I emailed her and basically said something like “Hey, the night temps are getting in the 40s and the trees in the courtyard are going to die. Are there any plans for them? Such as moving them indoors or replanting somewhere else?”

And she replied basically saying “I’m sure the landscaping company will take care of it!”

Spoiler: they will not. Again, unless something has changed I have watched this same cycle repeat every summer for the last 4 years. Trees die in October, are shriveled twigs by Thanksgiving, and come spring the company comes by, rips them out, and replants brand new ones for the summer season.

I don’t want to watch a 6 foot tall, thriving FLF tree die again for no reason. My wife says I’m “totally crazy” if I go out there one night this week, dig one out and move it to a pot and bring it inside.

I would spray it down in my shower and give it 2-3 rounds of insecticidal soap treatment before moving it to the same room with my other plants.

Thoughts? Am I really the “crazy plant guy”? What would you do?",65,262,0.97,houseplants

Does anyone have any sure fire tips for how to keep their pets away from their plant collections?

16pktoo,1695415288.0,Collection size doesn't matter,"Here's my hot take as plant parent of a pretty decently sized collection and starting to get a more plant focused social media feed: it doesn't matter how big your collection is, it matters if it's healthy. I HATE seeing people with 20+ plants that are putting others down but if you truly look at their ""large"" collection they're clearly neglected. Some are browning, dry,  over watered, need a bigger or smaller pot, wrong potting mix, ect. It doesn't matter if you have an entire jungle, if they're not healthy it's just not okay. I despise that some people try to constantly one up each other or invalidate other collectors because how many plants they own as opposed to how much they've grown under their care. You could own one succulent, but it could be the best succulent I've ever seen, you're no less of a plant collector than someone who has dozens. You could have dozens of shitty, neglected plants but that doesn't mean you're better than someone who only owns one. It doesn't matter how many you own, how rare or expensive they are, your equipment, it only matters if your plant or plants are healthy, you are still a valid plant owner nonetheless.

Edit: let me specify, I don't dislike large collections that are well maintained and loved, I have one of my own. I'm saying the people who have big collections who invalidate other plant owners for having 1 or 2 very well cared for plants because they don't have a lot, while their ""large"" collection is so big it's neglected.

To me, it's just a way to make more money and maybe even be scamming people. And usually the prices for one plant are high enough already. Is there something more to it? I would love to think these people aren't just greedy, but I have a hard time believing they aren't.


edit: i understand now that most of the time its for the packaging and labor costs to have it shipped!

16u1kb6,1695861839.0,how does my plan to get rid of thrips look…,"I’m someone that has to physically write things out. Hence the photo. Lol.

Today I noticed thrips on my rattlesnake calathea; I sprayed it down in the shower then put out on my windy balcony.
Then I found them on my FAVORITE calathea (on the other side of my condo!!!) - my luscious orbifolia. This is when I got anxiety. 
I put this one out on my windy balcony too, but never sprayed it down cause I just don’t want them to spread anymore in the house. I have a cat and I know they spread them around too. 

I’m assuming they’ve been there for 2-3 weeks, probably got in when I brought home my cat lol.
One of the plants was in VERY close proximity/touching a large ficus Audrey, a mini monstera and my hoya kerii but I haven’t seen anything on any of those plants.

I’m not in any financial place (or have enough patience) to repot my entire plant collection (30ish plants) - so I’d really like to avoid that. But if I have to I’ll repot these 2. 

I don’t feel like having to wipe every leaf down and have to battle them over and over again. It’s not worth the anxiety. So I will toss them if I have to. 

Very annoyed because I’ve had no issues with pests (with no treatment/prevention) for the last 2years. 

Plan:

Day 1:
1. Spray all of my plants’ leaves with a rubbing alcohol solution

2. Water all with hydrogen peroxide

3. Apply dichotomous earth to all

Day 2:

4. Spinosad (repeating every 3 days)

5. Spray soil with hydrogen peroxide? (or spinosad?)

Watering days: repeat day 1

If there is no progress for a month, I’ll consider beneficials but will more likely just trash the plants.

anyway, i’ve only ever owned succulents — i bought one (1) houseplant a few months ago, which i believe was a more variegated version of the pink plant on the right. but it came soaked so i brushed away all the soil and set it down to let it dry. it was fine at first when i checked up on it hours later, but after that, within like 2 hours it went from still fine to absolutely perished beyond help. the succulent next to it, that i was also doing that to, was completely fine & it was then that i remembered that succulents and houseplants are not the same 😕

so! any tips or advice y’all have for someone getting into houseplants after months of only owning succulents, please send my way!!

16yqv0m,1696336834.0,Philodendrons and monsteras are ruining my life,"Not in the sense of ""I can't stop buying them"" but ""I literally cannot water them properly and they die but I still continue buying them because I'm a closeted masochist"".

Philodendrons are touted as one of the easiest kinds of houseplants, yet I've killed all of the ones I've owned. I have a pink princess, white knight and ring of fire, and they're dying slowly and miserably. They're in appropriately sized nursery pots with cache pots. I water them every 7-10 days, drain the excess, and they still show signs of overwatering.

Same with monsteras. I have a monstera deliciosa and I splurged on a Thai constellation this summer. I split the deliciosa into two plants when it was dying, one of them died completely, and the other half is doing ""okay"". The Thai constellation started browning at the edges on all leaves, and I initially thought it was a low humidity thing, but the lowest leaf is turning yellow. But the leaves with brown aren't yellow. I live in Iowa if that helps.

What do I do? Should I chop all of these guys up and propagate them? I repotted them maybe a month ago with a new soil mix and the roots looked fine at the time, but they're still suffering.

Pics of my Thai begging for mercy. Thank you in advance for any advice.

EDITED TO ADD: Would my Thai (and philodendrons) be better off being chopped up and propagated in some sphagnum moss? I'm leaving for a 10-day road trip next week and I'm terrified of coming back to a heavily deceased, expensive plant.

I also should have mentioned that there obviously are signs of overwatering, but when I've waited longer, the leaves curl up from thirst which also isn't a great thing to happen frequently. So like, I know what overwatering is and how I should avoid that, but when I do try to avoid that they curl up. So I guess what I'm asking now is, which is less detrimental?

**EDIT 2: A few people have mentioned they see either spider mites or thrips. Which would explain why the Thai is browning with little to no yellow! So if that's the case (I'll check when I get home) how do you recommend I treat them? I've never dealt with spider mites or thrips to my knowledge. I'm thinking I'm going to chop them up to propagate anyway since they're all doing so poorly, but how would you recommend I treat the cuttings? Pests would make sense because my Thai, white knight, and PPP were all sitting together, and my philo ring of fire is in a separate room and doing fine with the same care.**

I’m super paranoid about pests (I live in Canada where systemic pesticides are banned) and I was wondering if I should adopt this practice?

A pillow fell on it… The leaf was still attached but completely limp. I couldn’t bring myself to chop the leaf off ( it wasn’t enough to propagate, and she was my first variegated beauty) so I stutted it by putting a glass vase next to it. I made sure the leaf was in the correct postition so it could heal. I had little hope but I had tried the best I could. I checked carefully after a few weeks when I noticed the leaf wasn’t starting to wilt yet. But it would still would bend when I lowered my hand. I put it back and left it like that for months. I think 4 months in total but maybe it had healed already before I finally removed the vase/ crutches.

The spot where it had snapped has gotten woodier and you can still see some scarring but it holds up!  I was c ery pleased with myself. As I was the one who broke it..

I saw it at my local garden center and couldn’t stop thinking about, had to go get it this morning. 

While I haven’t found any obvious signs of pests, I’ve learned my lesson and will keep it away from all the others until I know it’s safe. 

So after the quarantine period is over, what the hell should I do with it?? 

I’ve gotten really into houseplants this past year and through a lot of trial and error, I’ve come a long way in understanding their needs, but I still have plenty to learn. I have several fussy prayer plants and think I’ve learned their light and soil preferences, but this monster feels like a whole new undertaking. 

How quickly should I re-pot it? Should I split it up asap or let it stay bunched as long as it looks healthy? I’ve lost some prayer plants from splitting them up too aggressively, thinking they needed more breathing room than they did. But this is crazy packed, right?

All suggestions welcome please!

I was about ten. But around the time I hit puberty, I kinda grew out of it and simply didn't care about plants at all for years.

When I moved out at 19, my aunt said that every home needs a plant, she gave me ten euros and I got a peace lily just because I had to get *something* to avoid the complaints. It struggled and thrived whenever it felt like it and it annoyed me so much. 

When I turned 21, I slowly started liking that plant because no matter what happened in my life (those two years were pretty rough for me), it survived and I guess it kind of gave me some hope haha Like, if a plant can survive my neglect, maybe I'll pull through as well. 

I looked up some basic peace lily care and decided to divide it since there were like three new ones. Every single one, except the smallest one died and I kind of made it my mission to help it survive no matter what. And as it started growing new leaves, my heart filled with joy. You can probably guess where this is going now lmao

Fast forward to now and I just got my 14th plant in my tiny 25m² (270ft²) apartment. Only half of it gets sunlight from a west facing window, in Finland lol But my peace lily is thriving. Can't wait for it to flower one day. Every plant fills me with this childlike joy I thought I lost a long time ago.

But also, I can finally share my new obsession with my mom and when I was walking in the garden with her, my mind was flooded with memories from my childhood and I got pretty emotional. She gave me some plant cuttings and it honestly made me so happy! 

Just kinda felt like sharing, thanks for reading :) I'm just happy I found this hobby again. I think I'm getting kinda good at it too since pretty much every plant seems to be doing decently and putting out new leaves!

What I'm *not* happy about is my peperomia caperata rejecting my love and care lmao I haven't killed a plant in such a long time, but the leaves keep dropping. I guess that's my next mystery.",4,33,0.97,houseplants

16mi0d6,1695099953.0,Magical disappearing thrips???,"Three entire generations of my spider plants started to look really rough a few weeks ago. A strange malaise was affecting my poor spider plant matriarch and its many babies and grandbabies. To make a long and traumatic story short, it was motherfucking thrips. Motherfucking thrips were inside my home and it was a motherfucking all-you-can-eat thrips buffet, baby. These motherfucking no good thrips were turning my spider plants into the dancefloor from that one scene in the Barbie movie and every night was a party. If you're a nasty little motherfucker about an eighth of an inch long with a bad attitude and a penchant for wanton destruction, you're invited. 

Strangely they weren't very prolific -- I spotted a couple of the wretched little bastards here and there on my spider plants, but all of my other plants were apparently unmolested by these motherfucking goddamn thrips. I guess they were content with the flavor profile offered by my poor spiders. Just a regular bunch of nasty little motherfucking gourmands, I guess. Here's the twist: I got on my hands and knees and inspected every leaf on every plant in my house with a flashlight and a prayer and I found virtually no eggs. Lots of munch marks, but no babies. Not a single motherfucking tot. Maybe they were all too full to fuck. It happens. I sprayed the hell out of everything in my home that photosynthesizes with a persuasively named aerosol called ""Dr Doom"" and a fine mist of rubbing alcohol for garnish just to be safe, and the only pest I've seen around here in days is my housemate. 

What is going on???? Where are all these motherfucking thrips? What have they done with their motherfucking offspring? Google tells me that it takes thrips eggs about 4 days to hatch. WHERE ARE ALL THE SPROGS????? Their inactivity has only increased my feelings of fear and anxiety. Did they leave? Were they impotent? Did I accidentally host a convention for insect antinatalists? I armed myself for war only to be stood up on the battlefield, but it can't be that easy, can it? Is it over? Did I win???",16,30,0.97,houseplants

Yesterday I noticed some weird leaf damage on my echeveria, and then started inspecting my other plants. I think they all have thrips😭😭😭😭 I’m in a small apartment so all of my plants are pretty close together, so all but 4 need to be treated (I have 24 plants in total). I’m so discouraged and am feeling daunted with the task, but some of these plants I have had for 5 years and do not want to give up on.
My plan is insecticidal soap wash-down this weekend, and then diatomaceous earth on soil/leaves, then repeat for a few weeks? I am also confused where the thrips came from, ugh.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking, but I have an inkling that you treat them differently than plants that are not as bushy near the top soil? I may be overthinking it tho :)

I like going through my plants and looking at all the leaves (esp for pest monitoring), but this peperomia is a beast and the pictures don’t do it justice. 

I’ve read that peperomias are semi-succulents, does this mean anything involving roots and space within the pot? I was tempted to repot into a bigger size because the soil wasn’t budging when I tried replacing to a grittier soil. 

The roots were tiny (like succulent roots) and have just started crawling up the inside of the pot. It’s still in its original pot with some grittier soil. Should I have gone into it with a bamboo stick to release the roots and soil?

Sorry if this is a silly question!",6,27,0.94,houseplants

This plant is the only one that survived from what I bought at that time & it’s somehow managed to thrive without drainage, also low light due to a house move. I love her! Do Jade plants like to be snug because the pot really is so small?

Looking for any advice how to maintain her - at some point I’m nervous how I’ll remove without damaging when the pot becomes inevitably too small so I have no idea what to do really. I have snipped a branch to attempt propagating in water too incase that’s what I’ll need to do in the long term. I may attempt planting a branch in soil too. 

I’ve always loved plants but very much a beginner in terms of learning about propagating & repotting. I may post a few Qs on here over the weeks due to being off work with stress - learning about plants has become really therapeutic & rewarding for me recently.

16kzbgg,1694953344.0,One step from binning all of my plants. How can I PERMANENTLY get rid of fungus gnats UK?,"In the last 12 months I have tried: 

\- Drying my plants out to the point I killed 2 of them. 2 plants are currently bone dusty dry and when I tap their bots the gnats swarm out of them and the soil is full of babies. It's causing severe damage to my other plants.

\-Hydrogen peroxide did nothing. It costs a lot of money and I've tried 9% multiple times with no effect. The gnats survived multiple rounds of it over 2 months. 

\- Cinnamon and spice powders. Absolute joke. 

\- Sand on top, gravel and sand at the bottom. I bought thick sand, too. I placed up to 3 inches on the top, 1 inch layer of gravel and 3 inches of sand on the bottom. The soil is in the middle. They dig straight through the sand like it doesn't exist. 

\- Pot covers. They dig through the top soil even if the bottom holes are blocked. As I said, I've sealed the top with sand. 

\- Changed the soil, bleached the new pots. Cleared them out for a short period but I cannot repot my plants once per week, especially when winter is coming up.

\- Poison. Extermination. Whatever killer is available. DOES. NOT WORK. All the recommended ones failed. All the non-recommended ones failed. If you can name it, I tried it. They survived. 

My house is literally SWARMING with them. I live in England so it is quite humid. My plants are dry, full of rocks and sand and blocked at the bottom and they are all infested. No matter how parched, wilted and poisoned they are the gnats live. These gnats have actually killed 5 plants and are stressing my family members. I have a lot of house plants and anything that is not a cactus is permanently and severely infested, even some of the cacti are severely infested. I'm so stressed because my plants are dying and I'm spitting these bugs out. Can anyone find an option that will permanently destroy them? Otherwise I'm going to have to bin my beautiful and at times expensive plants :'( ",146,18,0.71,houseplants

1727v43,1696689406.0,Scindapsus trebuii Moonlight,"Hi everyone, first time poster and long-time lurker. My first foray into house plants and been nursing these Moonlight beauties for about a year after picking up from a home hardware store (see before pic). For reference, the shorter one in the white pot is Atlas and the taller one in yellow is Gladys.

After winter closer to the growing season,  I had to separate and re-pot Gladys because of some fungus gnats and they’ve both been flourishing ever since during their summer season (proper soil mixture, drainage, liquid fertilizer with purified water). But they’re both growing so tall! Especially Gladys, who’s not as full as her sister (I’m guessing because of the pot), whereas Atlas seems to be fuller and shorter.

Every morning Gladys’s vines are getting longer and I’m not sure how to appropriately manage that, is it getting out of control? Lol. I rotate her every week-ish and have been training the vines to not defy gravity so dramatically. Also Gladys has had some curled leaves basically ever since I got her and they never flattened out, but retain their dark color and silver hue.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking, but I have an inkling that you treat them differently than plants that are not as bushy near the top soil? I may be overthinking it tho :)

I like going through my plants and looking at all the leaves (esp for pest monitoring), but this peperomia is a beast and the pictures don’t do it justice. 

I’ve read that peperomias are semi-succulents, does this mean anything involving roots and space within the pot? I was tempted to repot into a bigger size because the soil wasn’t budging when I tried replacing to a grittier soil. 

The roots were tiny (like succulent roots) and have just started crawling up the inside of the pot. It’s still in its original pot with some grittier soil. Should I have gone into it with a bamboo stick to release the roots and soil?

Looking for any advice how to maintain her - at some point I’m nervous how I’ll remove without damaging when the pot becomes inevitably too small so I have no idea what to do really. I have snipped a branch to attempt propagating in water too incase that’s what I’ll need to do in the long term. I may attempt planting a branch in soil too. 

I’ve always loved plants but very much a beginner in terms of learning about propagating & repotting. I may post a few Qs on here over the weeks due to being off work with stress - learning about plants has become really therapeutic & rewarding for me recently.

Of course root rot nailed it and I noticed the stems just falling out of the soil. 

I repotted it in new, dry soil and appear to have saved what was left. In an effort to not have a total loss, I bought this Burpee seed starter kit that holds water in the bottom. Planted up the leaves from the stems I removed.

It’s too tall for my house and I’d hate to kill it by not meeting its needs. 

Online advice is all over the place. If possible I plan to cut the top 2 feet off, plant the top and try to get it to root. I’ve read about notching the trunk to try to induce it to fill out. Will be repotting both  with fresh soil.

176zxnh,1697207037.0,I potted some golden pothos cuttings I took this summer 6th of September and..,".. here they are around a month later. I bought a medium sized pothos this summer, and found it to have root rot. So I took some cuttings, cut off as much rot as I could and repotted the rest of it in a smaller pot. But still no growth, just a lot of grief from it. Checked it and sill rot 2 months later 😑, and only a top cut was viable from it by then, which has been propagated in water and soil the last month. 

From the cuttings I took earlier this summer, they were potted together a month ago.
I would've left them in the 4 inch pot until spring if it wasn't for all the roots poking through the bottom, but they were starting to grow secondary roots and I didn't want to have to damage them getting it out of the pot in spring, so it had to be repotted now. And now I could also fit that top cut I took in the late summer.

Look at them beautiful roots. It's been thriving since I changed from soil+perlite to a chunkier mix, the pothos is an insanely fast rooter, Jesus.",2,7,1.0,houseplants

177zk2w,1697318906.0,What should i do with my large dieffenbachia?,"What should i do with this?

I was gifted this dieffenbachia tropic snow in this pot. It hasn’t had much problems in this pot other than the brown tips i’m seeing recently but it does not have drainage and it’s probably been over a year since i’ve had it like this.

I’m wondering what i should do with it? Should i just leave it if it’s not showing 
signs of problems, repot it into a pot with drainage, or chop it to propogate the top half and all the nodes on the stem?

The last photo is its newest leaf, it’s a little smaller than some of the others i have. This is the biggest plant i have so im just unfamiliar with how to go about this.

1796bvk,1697463935.0,I need some help with my monstera :(,"Dear people with green thumbs.. I need your help before I give up.

I am a known plant unaliver.. so far, the only plants that have survived in my care are snake plant(barely tbh, but seems to be doing great lately), dracaena marginata and, as of recently, a few coffee plants that I saved from a pot that had like 15 of them planted in one small pot.

I bought this monstera in the end of july.  When I repotted it after bringing it home, I chose to not untangle the roots. For the first month it was doing good.

In september I did a little research and realized that there are multiple plants in one pot. So I decided to repot it again. I untangled the roots (lost some small roots in the process), potted it in a perlite, potting soil and orchid bark mix(but this mix was not well draining enough), put a pole in the pot for support and also turned the plant in one direction(before it was growing in 3 different directions). 

A week ago I noticed fungus gnats, 2 leaves had turned yellow and fallen off and 2 of the new leaves turned brown(attached pic). 

I realize my mistakes - potting soil not airy enough, it might not get enough sun, pot too big and it tends to get humid in my apartment around this time of the year. Maybe I was too rough on it when replanting. Is it normal to lose roots when untangling?

But is there anything I can do now to save it? Because I am about to give up on it.. I cried when saw the condition this plant was in when I came home after being away for a week. 

Rn I bave rinsed the roots, cut off dead roots (actually noticed some tiny fresh roots) and dipped it in hydrogen peroxide and water mix to disinfect the roots. Now they are drying off.. 

I was thinking about planting it in a better draining potting mix, in a plastic pot with more drainage holes and putting it in a spot with a little bit more sun. But I am just so tired of seeing plants die. Because every time when I try to give them better conditions, they die.

178kghg,1697391223.0,Hate pests? Here’s a good read.,"A lot, if not most, of houseplant owners deal with pests at some point, with thrips seemingly causing the most damage. Most “veteran” hobbyists will recommend using systemic granules (active ingredient: Imidacloprid) and/or spinosad sprays. Systemic granules seem to be the easy way out, with the process being “mix it in your media(soil), water it in, and let it do it’s magic”, compared to “spray it all down including all nooks and crannies, keep away from light after spraying, then repeat after a week and maybe another week”.

Let me burst your bubble. Systemics may help with thrips, but you risk a spider mite outbreak, since the active ingredient increases their reproduction.

Canadians, if y’all ever go to the US for pest control, get spinosad instead if you can lol. They’re not illegal, just heavily regulated for personal use, and must be declared at border patrol.

177ls85,1697276273.0,about 1 month growth of my monstera and my watering period,"Good day to everyone.

In the photos below you can see the growth of my monstera plant within 1 month, which I bought last month. I bought my monstera from Ikea and located it near the window. The first thing I noticed are brown spots on some leaves. It is not on every leaf, but I think it is because I opened the tulle for the first 2-3 days and exposed it to direct sunlight. Except for the first 3 days, the net is always closed and the light does not hit directly. I water it once a week with about 500 ml of filtered water. I check the soil by hand, but of course it is not possible to measure its dryness, so for now I water it once a week. Its own inner pot is a drainage pot. How do you think the monstera is growing?

Also 3 new leaves have started to grow. The extension roots have not started to grow yet. When should I get that hugging stick I see on monsteras?

176l2am,1697154239.0,rant - ready to give up on plant parenting :'(,"**Tl;DR i put so much effort into plant care, but i've had to throw away six plants that were less than a year old. i love how they bring life to my space, but they also stress and depress me. looking for motivational stories (or a sign to give up) + advice about quarantining old plants from my new ones.**

i only just found thrips on my monstera, which i've invested lots of time (and money) in. it used to be huge, then had to be beheaded because it was badly burned, then repotted because it was extremely root bound, and now it has thrips. it was thriving in spring, then started putting out wrinkly leaves a few months ago, then one month ago one leaf's tips started turning brown. a few started curling a little but i thought it was under/over-watering. then was cleaning one of the leaves a few days ago, and realised five of the leaves (which i was OVERJOYED to see sprout in spring) have thrips. 

i'm ready to throw it out (even though i literally just bought bonide and D Earth) because i'm just exhausted. this is the seventh plant i've thrown out this year, and all of them were a few months to a year old: 

* **Calathea Compactstar.** it was also badly burned, i had to chop a lot of leaves off, but spring came and fertiliser helped it grow 10 new leaves. then they all started yellowing come autumn.
* **Purple Passion.** it was one of my first plants and i severely overwatered it.
* **Crassula Hobbit.** it was a gift from a friend who bought it at a grocery store. three months into getting it, the leaves started falling like crazy. i think it was overwatering. propagation didn't work.
* **Peace Lily.** which is INSANE, right????? the easiest one to take care of, but i still didn't get it right. i don't know if i somehow overwatered it - started drooping, i watered it, only drooped more, eventually just gave up on life. relatable, tbh.
* **Pink Polka Dot Plant.** girlie never stood a chance.
* **Sweet Potato.** i put it in a vase full of water and it was sprouting like crazy for 3 months, but then died a horrible death. 

i don't know what i'm looking for, i think i just needed to rant about this. maybe there's no shame in being a bad plant parent. it's definitely taught me a lot about whether i should have kids (lol) and anger management.

**i would appreciate some advice** \- i'm getting new plants delivered in a few days (i ordered them before having this revelation on whether plant care is worth the time......) and i don't know if i should throw all my old plants away in case the thrips spread. my other plan is to quarantine all the old plants in my room and brush all the leaves with D Earth then shower them, and sprinkle bonide (which SEVERELY hurt my bank account, don't know why it costs so much in the UK) on all of the plants to prevent future gnats and thrips.

if you're wondering what plants i have left:

* **Propagated Monstera.** i'm paranoid that they're infested with thrips that haven't matured to be seen yet, but so far they're thriving - even put out two new leaves. one of them is discoloured on one side though, and the other is a little wrinkly.
* **Purple Passion.** it's a singular stem that's slowly growing, but was infested with gnats for a month. treated with sticky traps and hydrogen peroxide. it's looking droopy lately and i'm worried it's thrips.
* **Chinese Money Plant.** it's one of the few plants that's given me the LEAST trouble except the leaves fall off quite a lot.
* **Snake Plant.** the plant that's the least fussy, except i kept it right next to my monstera until i discovered thrips. really really scared that they've spread, especially because my snake plant is the only reason for staying a plant parent.
* **Set of four succulents.** i'm convinced my fairy washboard isn't real because it hasn't grown a centimetre since i got it, but i know it's notoriously slow at growing. the ghost echeveria and gasteria are the loves of my life. but my silver dollar plant also lost a lot of leaves, two stems fell right off and i'm kind of done with it.
* **Global Green Pothos.** low maintenance queen! was one of my favourites but some of the leaves started yellowing and they all belonged to a vine that ripped right off, not really rooted at all. recently repotted it (with very minimal effort tbh) because it came in a pot with no drainage????? and the top started getting white and crusty............also found some mites in it, but according to google they're healthy for the plant and aren't pest mites.........fingers crossed.

thanks for reading y'all, idk if i'm looking for encouragement or someone to tell me to give up. maybe i'm just projecting the stress in my personal life on my plants. my flatmate says it's because they've osmosised (LOL) my depression and absorbed my sad vibes (jokingly, but i think she's onto something). the irony of all this is that i'm dressing as poison ivy for halloween 🤡🤡🤡",6,2,0.67,houseplants

I noticed that there were some spider mites, so I hoped that by putting them outside, they might go away. Not only did they go away, but my ficus plants had astonishing growth! The new leaves were quite big and glossy on my ficus elastica and my ficus benjamina developed a thick coat of leaves. Obviously, you can't put every plant outside in full sun, but light loving plants will definetly perk up outside. 

Just make sure you acclimate them properly, or otherwise, all of your leaves will burn up. And if you get hail, protect your plants, plants with big leaves like ficus elastica will get noticeable damage from that. I would know, since I forgot to move mine away...

Obviously, I had to bring mine inside for autumn, I was pretty reluctant on getting them inside though, so some leaves got cold nipped...

It had a QR code for plant care, but then just took me to a website with a ton of different plants listed. It looks most like the “ficus ginseng bonsai” but I’m not sure. It recently started to spread out, its leaves turning more yellow, curling and dropping. 

Current Care:
* Lighting: Indirect but sunny
* Room temperature (70°–78°)
* Water: A few times a week, soil never soggy
* Have never used fertilizer, but just ordered some
* Location: Previously away from window, moved closer recently but now I’m not sure where to put it.  

More info:
1.  The white pebbles appear to be loosely glued in, but have soil underneath. I’m not sure when I need to re-plant/re-pot it or if the glued pebbles are bad for it. 
2. I thought it wasn’t getting enough lighting at first, so I moved it by a windowsill for indirect light. That’s when things got worse. I think it might be too much air flow, given that it was next to an air purifier. 
3. Maybe the issue is lack of fertilizer or too infrequent watering. Should I mist it daily?
4. The brand is “Livetrends.”
5. I like it and I really don’t want to fail it.

17a45z7,1697564956.0,Tips for a low-maintenance climbing vine / plant that can take some direct light?,"Hi plant lovers! I am thinking about growing some vines up the wall above my stairs. [Here's the wall in question](https://imgur.com/a/u15SNGO). The wall is east-facing and across from some large floor-to-ceiling windows, and thus gets a few hours of direct morning sunlight (the light moves left to right so right side will get a bit more). Light for the rest of the day is medium / bright indirect.

My plan is to plant climbing vines in wall-mounted pots along the top of the railing on the wall (or maybe down low by the stairs). Then I'd put hooks or trellis up the wall for the vines to climb up. I'd like to avoid too much damage to the wall (both by plants and by the hardware installation).

I don't have a ton of experience so would like something easy to maintain, robust, fast growing, and pretty / interesting looking, and will provide pretty thick coverage of the wall side-to-side as it grows up.

So I have a bunch of questions!

1. Which plant(s)? It would be cool to do multiple species but I'd be happy with one good one and that would probably be easier.
2. I'd like to get pretty full coverage of the wall, how closely should I space the pots?
3. Any thoughts on hooks vs. trellis?
4. Any advice for wall-mounted pots that can adequately work in just dry wall? I could also potentially hang pots from the railing. Would want to keep them pretty low-profile though to keep the stairs clear for walking.

Thanks so much for your attention! Can't wait to green my space!",5,1,1.0,houseplants

In late August, most of the houseplants, including this one, had a strange white powder on them. The plants were repotted. This stuff was likely mycorrhiza, as told to me by the users here. 

Almost three weeks ago, 2 plants in the house had a bunch of gray fuzzy pieces. These were repotted a week later, and no growths were present then. Both times, the plants were repotted with store-bought bagged plant soil. 

I have severe mold phobia so this is incredibly stressful for me. 

Not sure if this is helpful, but both times the stuff disappeared immediately upon contact with water, which may support the idea that it was dust or minerals, though that doesn't make much sense to me. 

Just now, I saw this on this plant. I am worried because there is one piece that looks really fuzzy (circled in a picture) and some of the other pieces seem to have a bit of fuzz. 

Is this just normal texture for potting soil, or is this crap moldy AGAIN?!?!

Also, what is the more correct way to have the plant growing on the pole? I see people wrap it around, or have the vine growing upwards. I have been doing both, but both come with problems too. Grows too tall and a pole can only go so high and it’s worse when it’s tipping (hate chopping and propping). Wrapping it around it looks ugly since not everywhere gets full of leaves and the vine gets trained to the wrapping around the pole and hardens. 

I hate asking a stupid question I should know by now, but since my plants have been growing bigger, a lot of them are on poles now and just stacking more poles as it grows. I don’t even have the space for this 😩

My husband got me this angel wing begonia in June. He said he liked it because it doesn’t have to be potted and thought the roots looked cool. It came in this container. The instructions were to change the water out once a week with distilled or rain water, which I do (distilled). However, one by one, the leaves change colors  and fall off. It’s like the green color fades away, leaving the leaf looking more translucent. The front of the leaf becomes pinkish and the bottom becomes greenish, which is opposite from how they normally are. Eventually, the edges turn wrinkly and light brown, then the whole leaf does, and it just falls off. 

I’ve looked at other photos of issues for this type of begonia online and on Reddit, but I haven’t found any that seem similar. What am I doing wrong? Can I fix it?

* *Plerandra elegantissima*: I messed up the substrate mixture so that it barely held any moisture.
* *Polyscias fruticosa*: Root rot. It was situated in a ceramic pot without a drainage hole, so there was excess water standing inside the pot.
* *Syngonium podophyllum ""pink allusion""*: I have no clue! Every new growth turned into goo and smelled like sweaty feet.

The plant just seems happy to me – It grew some of its tallest chutes ever this summer, it drinks water at a seemingly healthy pace, no bugs, no dying leaves, etc. It is a little root bound but not terribly by any means, and the last time I repotted it to something larger was about 10 months ago. Is it already needing to be repotted again? It has a great spot light wise - It’s in a room with north facing light and only sometimes will get a little direct light around sunset. Could it be too bright? I’ve had it in that same general area of my apartment’s front room for the 2 1/2 years I’ve lived here and never had any issues.

I noticed that there were some spider mites, so I hoped that by putting them outside, they might go away. Not only did they go away, but my ficus plants had astonishing growth! The new leaves were quite big and glossy on my ficus elastica and my ficus benjamina developed a thick coat of leaves. Obviously, you can't put every plant outside in full sun, but light loving plants will definetly perk up outside. 

Just make sure you acclimate them properly, or otherwise, all of your leaves will burn up. And if you get hail, protect your plants, plants with big leaves like ficus elastica will get noticeable damage from that. I would know, since I forgot to move mine away...

Obviously, I had to bring mine inside for autumn, I was pretty reluctant on getting them inside though, so some leaves got cold nipped...

17a45z7,1697564956.0,Tips for a low-maintenance climbing vine / plant that can take some direct light?,"Hi plant lovers! I am thinking about growing some vines up the wall above my stairs. [Here's the wall in question](https://imgur.com/a/u15SNGO). The wall is east-facing and across from some large floor-to-ceiling windows, and thus gets a few hours of direct morning sunlight (the light moves left to right so right side will get a bit more). Light for the rest of the day is medium / bright indirect.

My plan is to plant climbing vines in wall-mounted pots along the top of the railing on the wall (or maybe down low by the stairs). Then I'd put hooks or trellis up the wall for the vines to climb up. I'd like to avoid too much damage to the wall (both by plants and by the hardware installation).

I don't have a ton of experience so would like something easy to maintain, robust, fast growing, and pretty / interesting looking, and will provide pretty thick coverage of the wall side-to-side as it grows up.

So I have a bunch of questions!

1. Which plant(s)? It would be cool to do multiple species but I'd be happy with one good one and that would probably be easier.
2. I'd like to get pretty full coverage of the wall, how closely should I space the pots?
3. Any thoughts on hooks vs. trellis?
4. Any advice for wall-mounted pots that can adequately work in just dry wall? I could also potentially hang pots from the railing. Would want to keep them pretty low-profile though to keep the stairs clear for walking.

Thanks so much for your attention! Can't wait to green my space!",5,1,1.0,houseplants

* *Plerandra elegantissima*: I messed up the substrate mixture so that it barely held any moisture.
* *Polyscias fruticosa*: Root rot. It was situated in a ceramic pot without a drainage hole, so there was excess water standing inside the pot.
* *Syngonium podophyllum ""pink allusion""*: I have no clue! Every new growth turned into goo and smelled like sweaty feet.

17a45z7,1697564956.0,Tips for a low-maintenance climbing vine / plant that can take some direct light?,"Hi plant lovers! I am thinking about growing some vines up the wall above my stairs. [Here's the wall in question](https://imgur.com/a/u15SNGO). The wall is east-facing and across from some large floor-to-ceiling windows, and thus gets a few hours of direct morning sunlight (the light moves left to right so right side will get a bit more). Light for the rest of the day is medium / bright indirect.

My plan is to plant climbing vines in wall-mounted pots along the top of the railing on the wall (or maybe down low by the stairs). Then I'd put hooks or trellis up the wall for the vines to climb up. I'd like to avoid too much damage to the wall (both by plants and by the hardware installation).

I don't have a ton of experience so would like something easy to maintain, robust, fast growing, and pretty / interesting looking, and will provide pretty thick coverage of the wall side-to-side as it grows up.

So I have a bunch of questions!

1. Which plant(s)? It would be cool to do multiple species but I'd be happy with one good one and that would probably be easier.
2. I'd like to get pretty full coverage of the wall, how closely should I space the pots?
3. Any thoughts on hooks vs. trellis?
4. Any advice for wall-mounted pots that can adequately work in just dry wall? I could also potentially hang pots from the railing. Would want to keep them pretty low-profile though to keep the stairs clear for walking.

I noticed that there were some spider mites, so I hoped that by putting them outside, they might go away. Not only did they go away, but my ficus plants had astonishing growth! The new leaves were quite big and glossy on my ficus elastica and my ficus benjamina developed a thick coat of leaves. Obviously, you can't put every plant outside in full sun, but light loving plants will definetly perk up outside. 

Just make sure you acclimate them properly, or otherwise, all of your leaves will burn up. And if you get hail, protect your plants, plants with big leaves like ficus elastica will get noticeable damage from that. I would know, since I forgot to move mine away...

Obviously, I had to bring mine inside for autumn, I was pretty reluctant on getting them inside though, so some leaves got cold nipped...

In late August, most of the houseplants, including this one, had a strange white powder on them. The plants were repotted. This stuff was likely mycorrhiza, as told to me by the users here. 

Almost three weeks ago, 2 plants in the house had a bunch of gray fuzzy pieces. These were repotted a week later, and no growths were present then. Both times, the plants were repotted with store-bought bagged plant soil. 

I have severe mold phobia so this is incredibly stressful for me. 

Not sure if this is helpful, but both times the stuff disappeared immediately upon contact with water, which may support the idea that it was dust or minerals, though that doesn't make much sense to me. 

Just now, I saw this on this plant. I am worried because there is one piece that looks really fuzzy (circled in a picture) and some of the other pieces seem to have a bit of fuzz. 

Is this just normal texture for potting soil, or is this crap moldy AGAIN?!?!

I took it to a plant nursery to someone who may be able to take care of it. And if not then someone who has the courage to throw it out.

I am a known plant unaliver.. so far, the only plants that have survived in my care are snake plant(barely tbh, but seems to be doing great lately), dracaena marginata and, as of recently, a few coffee plants that I saved from a pot that had like 15 of them planted in one small pot.

I bought this monstera in the end of july.  When I repotted it after bringing it home, I chose to not untangle the roots. For the first month it was doing good.

In september I did a little research and realized that there are multiple plants in one pot. So I decided to repot it again. I untangled the roots (lost some small roots in the process), potted it in a perlite, potting soil and orchid bark mix(but this mix was not well draining enough), put a pole in the pot for support and also turned the plant in one direction(before it was growing in 3 different directions). 

A week ago I noticed fungus gnats, 2 leaves had turned yellow and fallen off and 2 of the new leaves turned brown(attached pic). 

I realize my mistakes - potting soil not airy enough, it might not get enough sun, pot too big and it tends to get humid in my apartment around this time of the year. Maybe I was too rough on it when replanting. Is it normal to lose roots when untangling?

But is there anything I can do now to save it? Because I am about to give up on it.. I cried when saw the condition this plant was in when I came home after being away for a week. 

Rn I bave rinsed the roots, cut off dead roots (actually noticed some tiny fresh roots) and dipped it in hydrogen peroxide and water mix to disinfect the roots. Now they are drying off.. 

I was thinking about planting it in a better draining potting mix, in a plastic pot with more drainage holes and putting it in a spot with a little bit more sun. But I am just so tired of seeing plants die. Because every time when I try to give them better conditions, they die.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking, but I have an inkling that you treat them differently than plants that are not as bushy near the top soil? I may be overthinking it tho :)

I like going through my plants and looking at all the leaves (esp for pest monitoring), but this peperomia is a beast and the pictures don’t do it justice. 

I’ve read that peperomias are semi-succulents, does this mean anything involving roots and space within the pot? I was tempted to repot into a bigger size because the soil wasn’t budging when I tried replacing to a grittier soil. 

The roots were tiny (like succulent roots) and have just started crawling up the inside of the pot. It’s still in its original pot with some grittier soil. Should I have gone into it with a bamboo stick to release the roots and soil?

Most pots are deep enough when I stake the pole in, but it still will lean or tip over. I don’t know how much more soil I can pack so it gets support. It’s very unattractive, and it’s something I just can’t figure out. 

Also, what is the more correct way to have the plant growing on the pole? I see people wrap it around, or have the vine growing upwards. I have been doing both, but both come with problems too. Grows too tall and a pole can only go so high and it’s worse when it’s tipping (hate chopping and propping). Wrapping it around it looks ugly since not everywhere gets full of leaves and the vine gets trained to the wrapping around the pole and hardens. 

I hate asking a stupid question I should know by now, but since my plants have been growing bigger, a lot of them are on poles now and just stacking more poles as it grows. I don’t even have the space for this 😩

My husband got me this angel wing begonia in June. He said he liked it because it doesn’t have to be potted and thought the roots looked cool. It came in this container. The instructions were to change the water out once a week with distilled or rain water, which I do (distilled). However, one by one, the leaves change colors  and fall off. It’s like the green color fades away, leaving the leaf looking more translucent. The front of the leaf becomes pinkish and the bottom becomes greenish, which is opposite from how they normally are. Eventually, the edges turn wrinkly and light brown, then the whole leaf does, and it just falls off. 

I’ve looked at other photos of issues for this type of begonia online and on Reddit, but I haven’t found any that seem similar. What am I doing wrong? Can I fix it?

178kghg,1697391223.0,Hate pests? Here’s a good read.,"A lot, if not most, of houseplant owners deal with pests at some point, with thrips seemingly causing the most damage. Most “veteran” hobbyists will recommend using systemic granules (active ingredient: Imidacloprid) and/or spinosad sprays. Systemic granules seem to be the easy way out, with the process being “mix it in your media(soil), water it in, and let it do it’s magic”, compared to “spray it all down including all nooks and crannies, keep away from light after spraying, then repeat after a week and maybe another week”.

Let me burst your bubble. Systemics may help with thrips, but you risk a spider mite outbreak, since the active ingredient increases their reproduction.

Here’s a good read for those interested: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11172074_Fecundity_in_Twospotted_Spider_Mite_Acari_Tetranychidae_is_Increased_by_Direct_and_Systemic_Exposure_to_Imidacloprid?mibextid=Zxz2cZ

Canadians, if y’all ever go to the US for pest control, get spinosad instead if you can lol. They’re not illegal, just heavily regulated for personal use, and must be declared at border patrol.

178hoik,1697383332.0,Fungus gnats - I don't know what to do except bin my houseplants,"Lost my job recently so have had to cut back on spending. Just realised I have a fungus gnat problem - I'm finding more and more gnats in random places around the house, even in rooms where I don't have plants. Realised they're coming from at least one large dracena, which (along with two other plants) I repotted / changed soil of around 2 months ago.

Mosquito BTI on amazon is expensive and I've heard of it not working for some people.

I could honestly cry. I love my plants but I can't stand the thought of this infestation getting progressively worse - I feel dirty because of it. Currently, I can see about 10 adult gnats around the plant. The two other plants that I repotted may have the same issue, I can't tell yet.

Yes, I let soil dry out well between watering. I rarely water at all.

&#x200B;

I have 11 plants in total and feel like I'm just going to have to get rid of them all and I'm absolutely heartbroken. Surely these gnats will have laid eggs in every pot by now? Oh my god.

I grew up in a household of fake plants. On my birthday, a houseplant was gifted to me. At first it was exciting to have one. However I was NOT prepared to be a plant parent. I was told that the houseplant I received can live for years & hardly needs to be watered/ that much sunlight to survive. Ok perfect right? I work 50+ hrs a week & have 2 cats that I already care for. So boom. I kept this thing in my bathroom. MIND YOU I AM TERRIFIED OF BUGS…. LIKE… TERRIFIED. All bugs. Doesn’t matter what kind. Harmless or not. I hate em. Can’t live with em & never have. A month later I saw some weird centepedey looking thing in my shower. Thought it was weird because I’d never saw anything like that before. (My apartment complex was just built last year so there are literally no bugs ever) …. I looked in the plant a few days ago & discover little bugs crawling around in the soil. I FREAKED!!!! It was a gift so I fought the urge to toss it completely & just put it out on the patio in a panic. Now I’m afraid to even go out there & touch it let alone keep the thing. But whatever there’s a new problem now. Suddenly tonight I’m seeing 2 silverfish in my bathroom when I came home. The little bugs looked like miniature silvs…. Like I said brand new apartment complex, never saw any bugs here ever especially not silverfish until I brought this plant home. I’m concerned guys. Do I now have a silverfish infestation? They move so fast I lost them before I could kill them. I vacuumed the bathroom IMMEDIATELY though. I had no clue that plants could bring bugs in. Does anyone else have experience with this? Like bugs traveling OUTSIDE your plants into your home? If so, how did you fix it? Is it really that bad? Do you think a month & some change of having that plant in my bathroom is enough to have caused an infestation or could they just be lone bugs that escaped the plant?

I repotted my Jade pothos somewhere in mid September as I noticed it has outgrown its pot and I was dealing with an early spider mite infestation (tears). I showered the plant with water, neem oil spray and repot it with new soil (50 potting mix/50 perlite).

Its been almost two weeks and the soil is still very moist. I was getting a bit worried that maybe my proportions are wrong and it might start to rot. Recently, I decided to make my own soil mix to include coco coir and orchid bark and thought maybe it would be best to repot it again to avoid rot.

After a few weeks I’ve noticed drooping so moved her in to better light & seems to be happier. However, I’ve been reading they actually go dormant over autumn/winter. She’s actually had a couple of new growths though so I’m unsure what to do - is it too early to “winterise” if she’s still growing, maybe I should leave well alone for the time being? 

I’ve seen people cut the stems to store the bulbs in a cool dry spot until spring. Do you absolutely have to do this with Caladiums? Or can I just leave alone over winter, trim leaves dying until spring in the hope she survives? If I do chop, can I propagate? 

I just don’t want to cut her, such a nice plant I’ve never owned so any advice would be so appreciated being a beginner! I have never stored bulbs so the process I’ll need to research. 

Thanks in advance :)

In the photos below you can see the growth of my monstera plant within 1 month, which I bought last month. I bought my monstera from Ikea and located it near the window. The first thing I noticed are brown spots on some leaves. It is not on every leaf, but I think it is because I opened the tulle for the first 2-3 days and exposed it to direct sunlight. Except for the first 3 days, the net is always closed and the light does not hit directly. I water it once a week with about 500 ml of filtered water. I check the soil by hand, but of course it is not possible to measure its dryness, so for now I water it once a week. Its own inner pot is a drainage pot. How do you think the monstera is growing?

Also 3 new leaves have started to grow. The extension roots have not started to grow yet. When should I get that hugging stick I see on monsteras?

However, I've noticed that I'm hitting the same spot that I hit with soil. I seem to have hit a threshold and I seem to be struggling with my plants. It's making me want to go back to soil, especially after discovering aroid mixes without any kind of dirt/peat/coco coir.

What do you guys think? Is semi-hydro actually worth sticking to? Does it have the benefits of faster and better growth than soil?

It had a QR code for plant care, but then just took me to a website with a ton of different plants listed. It looks most like the “ficus ginseng bonsai” but I’m not sure. It recently started to spread out, its leaves turning more yellow, curling and dropping. 

Current Care:
* Lighting: Indirect but sunny
* Room temperature (70°–78°)
* Water: A few times a week, soil never soggy
* Have never used fertilizer, but just ordered some
* Location: Previously away from window, moved closer recently but now I’m not sure where to put it.  

More info:
1.  The white pebbles appear to be loosely glued in, but have soil underneath. I’m not sure when I need to re-plant/re-pot it or if the glued pebbles are bad for it. 
2. I thought it wasn’t getting enough lighting at first, so I moved it by a windowsill for indirect light. That’s when things got worse. I think it might be too much air flow, given that it was next to an air purifier. 
3. Maybe the issue is lack of fertilizer or too infrequent watering. Should I mist it daily?
4. The brand is “Livetrends.”
5. I like it and I really don’t want to fail it.

1778are,1697230015.0,Can a potted hibiscus be moved indoors?,"First time poster here; forgive me if it's stupid or obvious question.  

Since buying a house a couple years ago, this was the first year I put plants outside other than the ones already planted around the house - generally in pots on the porch.   I have had three hibiscus plants since the middle of the summer.  They thrived outside in the sun and warm conditions.  Two different varieties (don't know what they were called).  Two of the plants had bloomed white and the non-flower part of the plant was seemingly less thick and sturdy than the other variety which was darker green and bloomed in red and yellow.  Anyway, the two white hibiscus are looking slightly haggard as it gets colder and the days shorter.  I'll probably toss them and replace them next spring.  But the red/yellow hibiscus still looks great and I was thinking instead of keeping it outside and eventually getting rid of it, I'd move it inside.

So what's the deal?  I'd assume it needs sun and my house gets good sun, though the days are getting very short so even with good internal sun, it may not be optimal. Placed outside, I watered it generally every other day in the peak of summer, sometimes on consecutive days if it was super hot.  Indoors it would need to be watered less?  

Thanks in advance.

They’re both producing less variegation on their leaves, with the leaves unfurling in a dark reddish-green with pinstripes of pink. I keep them both on a shelf with two grow lights (included among the pictures) and a gravel tray to bottom water, alongside a secondary tray to provide more humidity. Both were initially directly under the grow lights (I do need to lower that shelf down, please pardon the horde of Pothos as well), but the smaller PP was/is getting crispy leaf tips, while the larger one is fine, despite being so close. I’ve since moved them to the side and rotate as needed/daily. I’ve read a few pages online as to what can cause less variegation, though I’d thought the lights would be adequate; As well as the humidity, which I can up by lowering that orange tarp around the sides of the shelf.

Checked it and sill rot 2 months later 😑, and only a top cut was viable from it by then, which has been propagated in water and soil the last month. 

From the cuttings I took earlier this summer, they were potted together a month ago.
I would've left them in the 4 inch pot until spring if it wasn't for all the roots poking through the bottom, but they were starting to grow secondary roots and I didn't want to have to damage them getting it out of the pot in spring, so it had to be repotted now.

176s6r9,1697178257.0,Moving balcony plants indoors?,"Hi guys, I live in Sacramento CA, growing zone 9b :) I have a ton of plants growing on my balcony and walkway & now that it's getting cooler, it's time to start moving them in... (ftr, temperatures haven't gone below like 55 yet.) I'm wondering which ones I can leave out & which I should bring in.

On my balcony and walkway I have:
- Hoya publicallyx (bringing her in for sure)
- Purple heart (? It's still a little small so I'm nervous.)
- English Ivy
- Swedish Ivy
- Rosemary (It's young- about a foot and a half tall and spindly)
- Basil, mint, & peppers (coming in)
- Ginger (just regular edible ginger i stuck in a pot. It's got four huge stalks right now.)
- A mandevilla / rocktrumpet vine
- Prince of Orange (Coming in)
- Jade plant (Huge old and heavy- probably about four feet tall and shrubby. I made the mistake of not asking the guy I nabbed it from if it was okay to stay outside.)
- Two orchid cacti, shark tooth and unspecified. These are also both a little small.
- Black Bamboo (Pretty sure this one will be fine outside.)
- Banana Tree

I live in an apartment that's already crowded with plants and want to be selective about who I bring in :(  I moved here about 6 months ago and the window situation is less than ideal so I decided to try growing some of my bigger/ light-hungry guys outside. Obvs the collection blew up. 

For more specifics, Sacramento sometimes hits freezing for a few hours. (I think it got down to 32 once last year in the middle of the night.) Usually even in winter, daytime highs are above 50 and nighttime lows are around 40. We get a lot of rain & wind in winter, and we got some hail last year but that's rare.

17a0m6q,1697555544.0,Do you put your plants outside in Summer?,"Recently, I put a ficus elastica and a ficus benjamina outside in Summer and let me tell you, they were thriving. I noticed that there were some spider mites, so I hoped that by putting them outside, they might go away. Not only did they go away, but my ficus plants had astonishing growth! The new leaves were quite big and glossy on my ficus elastica and my ficus benjamina developed a thick coat of leaves. Obviously, you can't put every plant outside in full sun, but light loving plants will definetly perk up outside. 

Just make sure you acclimate them properly, or otherwise, all of your leaves will burn up. And if you get hail, protect your plants, plants with big leaves like ficus elastica will get noticeable damage from that. I would know, since I forgot to move mine away...

Obviously, I had to bring mine inside for autumn, I was pretty reluctant on getting them inside though, so some leaves got cold nipped...

17a45z7,1697564956.0,Tips for a low-maintenance climbing vine / plant that can take some direct light?,"Hi plant lovers! I am thinking about growing some vines up the wall above my stairs. [Here's the wall in question](https://imgur.com/a/u15SNGO). The wall is east-facing and across from some large floor-to-ceiling windows, and thus gets a few hours of direct morning sunlight (the light moves left to right so right side will get a bit more). Light for the rest of the day is medium / bright indirect.

My plan is to plant climbing vines in wall-mounted pots along the top of the railing on the wall (or maybe down low by the stairs). Then I'd put hooks or trellis up the wall for the vines to climb up. I'd like to avoid too much damage to the wall (both by plants and by the hardware installation).

I don't have a ton of experience so would like something easy to maintain, robust, fast growing, and pretty / interesting looking, and will provide pretty thick coverage of the wall side-to-side as it grows up.

So I have a bunch of questions!

1. Which plant(s)? It would be cool to do multiple species but I'd be happy with one good one and that would probably be easier.
2. I'd like to get pretty full coverage of the wall, how closely should I space the pots?
3. Any thoughts on hooks vs. trellis?
4. Any advice for wall-mounted pots that can adequately work in just dry wall? I could also potentially hang pots from the railing. Would want to keep them pretty low-profile though to keep the stairs clear for walking.

I like going through my plants and looking at all the leaves (esp for pest monitoring), but this peperomia is a beast and the pictures don’t do it justice. 

I’ve read that peperomias are semi-succulents, does this mean anything involving roots and space within the pot? I was tempted to repot into a bigger size because the soil wasn’t budging when I tried replacing to a grittier soil. 

The roots were tiny (like succulent roots) and have just started crawling up the inside of the pot. It’s still in its original pot with some grittier soil. Should I have gone into it with a bamboo stick to release the roots and soil?

In late August, most of the houseplants, including this one, had a strange white powder on them. The plants were repotted. This stuff was likely mycorrhiza, as told to me by the users here. 

Almost three weeks ago, 2 plants in the house had a bunch of gray fuzzy pieces. These were repotted a week later, and no growths were present then. Both times, the plants were repotted with store-bought bagged plant soil. 

I have severe mold phobia so this is incredibly stressful for me. 

Not sure if this is helpful, but both times the stuff disappeared immediately upon contact with water, which may support the idea that it was dust or minerals, though that doesn't make much sense to me. 

Just now, I saw this on this plant. I am worried because there is one piece that looks really fuzzy (circled in a picture) and some of the other pieces seem to have a bit of fuzz. 

Is this just normal texture for potting soil, or is this crap moldy AGAIN?!?!

1796bvk,1697463935.0,I need some help with my monstera :(,"Dear people with green thumbs.. I need your help before I give up.

I am a known plant unaliver.. so far, the only plants that have survived in my care are snake plant(barely tbh, but seems to be doing great lately), dracaena marginata and, as of recently, a few coffee plants that I saved from a pot that had like 15 of them planted in one small pot.

I bought this monstera in the end of july.  When I repotted it after bringing it home, I chose to not untangle the roots. For the first month it was doing good.

In september I did a little research and realized that there are multiple plants in one pot. So I decided to repot it again. I untangled the roots (lost some small roots in the process), potted it in a perlite, potting soil and orchid bark mix(but this mix was not well draining enough), put a pole in the pot for support and also turned the plant in one direction(before it was growing in 3 different directions). 

A week ago I noticed fungus gnats, 2 leaves had turned yellow and fallen off and 2 of the new leaves turned brown(attached pic). 

I realize my mistakes - potting soil not airy enough, it might not get enough sun, pot too big and it tends to get humid in my apartment around this time of the year. Maybe I was too rough on it when replanting. Is it normal to lose roots when untangling?

But is there anything I can do now to save it? Because I am about to give up on it.. I cried when saw the condition this plant was in when I came home after being away for a week. 

Rn I bave rinsed the roots, cut off dead roots (actually noticed some tiny fresh roots) and dipped it in hydrogen peroxide and water mix to disinfect the roots. Now they are drying off.. 

I was thinking about planting it in a better draining potting mix, in a plastic pot with more drainage holes and putting it in a spot with a little bit more sun. But I am just so tired of seeing plants die. Because every time when I try to give them better conditions, they die.

178ytpj,1697434660.0,Question about poles,"I’ve been collecting plants for years now, but I have no idea how to keep the pole straight in the pots. Most pots are deep enough when I stake the pole in, but it still will lean or tip over. I don’t know how much more soil I can pack so it gets support. It’s very unattractive, and it’s something I just can’t figure out. 

Also, what is the more correct way to have the plant growing on the pole? I see people wrap it around, or have the vine growing upwards. I have been doing both, but both come with problems too. Grows too tall and a pole can only go so high and it’s worse when it’s tipping (hate chopping and propping). Wrapping it around it looks ugly since not everywhere gets full of leaves and the vine gets trained to the wrapping around the pole and hardens. 

I hate asking a stupid question I should know by now, but since my plants have been growing bigger, a lot of them are on poles now and just stacking more poles as it grows. I don’t even have the space for this 😩

178kghg,1697391223.0,Hate pests? Here’s a good read.,"A lot, if not most, of houseplant owners deal with pests at some point, with thrips seemingly causing the most damage. Most “veteran” hobbyists will recommend using systemic granules (active ingredient: Imidacloprid) and/or spinosad sprays. Systemic granules seem to be the easy way out, with the process being “mix it in your media(soil), water it in, and let it do it’s magic”, compared to “spray it all down including all nooks and crannies, keep away from light after spraying, then repeat after a week and maybe another week”.

Let me burst your bubble. Systemics may help with thrips, but you risk a spider mite outbreak, since the active ingredient increases their reproduction.

Here’s a good read for those interested: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11172074_Fecundity_in_Twospotted_Spider_Mite_Acari_Tetranychidae_is_Increased_by_Direct_and_Systemic_Exposure_to_Imidacloprid?mibextid=Zxz2cZ

Canadians, if y’all ever go to the US for pest control, get spinosad instead if you can lol. They’re not illegal, just heavily regulated for personal use, and must be declared at border patrol.

My husband got me this angel wing begonia in June. He said he liked it because it doesn’t have to be potted and thought the roots looked cool. It came in this container. The instructions were to change the water out once a week with distilled or rain water, which I do (distilled). However, one by one, the leaves change colors  and fall off. It’s like the green color fades away, leaving the leaf looking more translucent. The front of the leaf becomes pinkish and the bottom becomes greenish, which is opposite from how they normally are. Eventually, the edges turn wrinkly and light brown, then the whole leaf does, and it just falls off. 

I’ve looked at other photos of issues for this type of begonia online and on Reddit, but I haven’t found any that seem similar. What am I doing wrong? Can I fix it?

I started putting my pothos plant out there because it was suffering in our office now that the light has started to shift in winter, but that led to me forgetting to water it as often. One day I asked my husband if I could dump his dirty bong water on the plant because our sink has low pressure and I didn’t want to have to wait to fill up a cup because I was exhausted from work and would inevitably forget what I was doing with the cup. He said sure, go ahead. In the weeks since doing this, he and I have been dumping his bong water into this plant, leading to a cleaner/ less gross bong. My plant loves it and has started growing huge leaves despite the lower light conditions, to which my husband stated he thinks it’s because of the nitrates from burning his green stuff.

I’ve not dealt with pests before, and honestly if I google I can find a photo that looks similar or completely different. 

I purchased this Adansonii the end of September. About a week later I noticed the spots - mid move - now settled in and most of the leaves look as pictured. 

Is this a shock issue? Watering issue? pests? 

It’s in a window with great light, and I give it a good soak once it’s almost dried out.

Mosquito BTI on amazon is expensive and I've heard of it not working for some people.

I could honestly cry. I love my plants but I can't stand the thought of this infestation getting progressively worse - I feel dirty because of it. Currently, I can see about 10 adult gnats around the plant. The two other plants that I repotted may have the same issue, I can't tell yet.

Yes, I let soil dry out well between watering. I rarely water at all.

I grew up in a household of fake plants. On my birthday, a houseplant was gifted to me. At first it was exciting to have one. However I was NOT prepared to be a plant parent. I was told that the houseplant I received can live for years & hardly needs to be watered/ that much sunlight to survive. Ok perfect right? I work 50+ hrs a week & have 2 cats that I already care for. So boom. I kept this thing in my bathroom. MIND YOU I AM TERRIFIED OF BUGS…. LIKE… TERRIFIED. All bugs. Doesn’t matter what kind. Harmless or not. I hate em. Can’t live with em & never have. A month later I saw some weird centepedey looking thing in my shower. Thought it was weird because I’d never saw anything like that before. (My apartment complex was just built last year so there are literally no bugs ever) …. I looked in the plant a few days ago & discover little bugs crawling around in the soil. I FREAKED!!!! It was a gift so I fought the urge to toss it completely & just put it out on the patio in a panic. Now I’m afraid to even go out there & touch it let alone keep the thing. But whatever there’s a new problem now. Suddenly tonight I’m seeing 2 silverfish in my bathroom when I came home. The little bugs looked like miniature silvs…. Like I said brand new apartment complex, never saw any bugs here ever especially not silverfish until I brought this plant home. I’m concerned guys. Do I now have a silverfish infestation? They move so fast I lost them before I could kill them. I vacuumed the bathroom IMMEDIATELY though. I had no clue that plants could bring bugs in. Does anyone else have experience with this? Like bugs traveling OUTSIDE your plants into your home? If so, how did you fix it? Is it really that bad? Do you think a month & some change of having that plant in my bathroom is enough to have caused an infestation or could they just be lone bugs that escaped the plant?

In the photos below you can see the growth of my monstera plant within 1 month, which I bought last month. I bought my monstera from Ikea and located it near the window. The first thing I noticed are brown spots on some leaves. It is not on every leaf, but I think it is because I opened the tulle for the first 2-3 days and exposed it to direct sunlight. Except for the first 3 days, the net is always closed and the light does not hit directly. I water it once a week with about 500 ml of filtered water. I check the soil by hand, but of course it is not possible to measure its dryness, so for now I water it once a week. Its own inner pot is a drainage pot. How do you think the monstera is growing?

Also 3 new leaves have started to grow. The extension roots have not started to grow yet. When should I get that hugging stick I see on monsteras?

177ogfd,1697286581.0,Help with my Aphelandra,"Hello everyone! New to the sub, I am just trying to get better at taking care of my house plants and move from a black to a yellow thumb, at least...

I got this Aphelandra 5 months ago. It grew new beautiful leaves, but in the past couple of months she started to have brown areas on the leaves, that would slowly extend...

She is kept inside the house, where there are more or less 12 - 25 degrees Celsius. She is watered every couple of days (she gets very floppy when she does not have enough water). I try not to overwater it. Sometimes I leave her in the balcony when the weather is nice, to let her get some sun, for just an hour or so, but otherwise she is always inside in a bright area of the house but away from the direct sun.

Any help? Should I cut the leaves? Thank you!

177o0xo,1697285091.0,Winterizing Caladium - beginner advice needed please? 🙏🏼,"Picked up this lovely Caladium a while back on offer in Lidl (UK) - love her! 

After a few weeks I’ve noticed drooping so moved her in to better light & seems to be happier. However, I’ve been reading they actually go dormant over autumn/winter. She’s actually had a couple of new growths though so I’m unsure what to do - is it too early to “winterise” if she’s still growing, maybe I should leave well alone for the time being? 

I’ve seen people cut the stems to store the bulbs in a cool dry spot until spring. Do you absolutely have to do this with Caladiums? Or can I just leave alone over winter, trim leaves dying until spring in the hope she survives? If I do chop, can I propagate? 

I just don’t want to cut her, such a nice plant I’ve never owned so any advice would be so appreciated being a beginner! I have never stored bulbs so the process I’ll need to research. 

Thanks in advance :)

My balcony faces south-east and gets sun from 8 am to 5 pm. When I bought it, I already told the seller that I would keep it outdoors on the balcony. Many of the branches have dried up, but fortunately the new babies are also growing. What anomalies do you notice about the plant in the photos? This is the first time I'm looking at a lavender.

By the way, I water about 100ml every morning on sunny days and every other day on cloudy days. I am worried about overwatering and rotting the roots. As you can see, the pot is drained.

Compared to 1 month ago, the branches seem to be a bit flattened. What could be the reason, or is this a sign of a problem?

The plant is on the balcony, that is, outdoors. I give filtered water once a week. Is this period enough for this plant? I check the soil every time, but it is difficult for me to notice in such detail whether it is completely dry or slightly moist. For this reason, I am worried about watering too often and rotting the roots, so I decided on once a week.

177e8iz,1697247098.0,Semi-Hydro vs. Soil,"The question of the century, semi-hydro or soil? I started off with soil and stuck with it for about 2 years, until I realized that almost all of my plants were rotting or doing very poorly. I switched to Leca and saw a considerable difference in time of growth and roots. It's been about a year for me.

However, I've noticed that I'm hitting the same spot that I hit with soil. I seem to have hit a threshold and I seem to be struggling with my plants. It's making me want to go back to soil, especially after discovering aroid mixes without any kind of dirt/peat/coco coir. I have 3 of my plants (2 syngoniums, 1 philodendron) in an extremely chunky aroid mix and they're doing wonderfully compared to my planrs in semi-hydro. But then I think about it and about a year ago, the roles were reversed, haha.

What do you guys think? Is semi-hydro actually worth sticking to? Does it have the benefits of faster and better growth than soil?

I look at people like SydenyPlantGuy and makes me want to go back to soil, but then I look at TheLeccaQueen or Dana Washington and tell myself, ""maybe I should stick with it"" haha. What's your guys's input?",0,0,0.5,houseplants

It had a QR code for plant care, but then just took me to a website with a ton of different plants listed. It looks most like the “ficus ginseng bonsai” but I’m not sure. It recently started to spread out, its leaves turning more yellow, curling and dropping. 

Current Care:
* Lighting: Indirect but sunny
* Room temperature (70°–78°)
* Water: A few times a week, soil never soggy
* Have never used fertilizer, but just ordered some
* Location: Previously away from window, moved closer recently but now I’m not sure where to put it.  

More info:
1.  The white pebbles appear to be loosely glued in, but have soil underneath. I’m not sure when I need to re-plant/re-pot it or if the glued pebbles are bad for it. 
2. I thought it wasn’t getting enough lighting at first, so I moved it by a windowsill for indirect light. That’s when things got worse. I think it might be too much air flow, given that it was next to an air purifier. 
3. Maybe the issue is lack of fertilizer or too infrequent watering. Should I mist it daily?
4. The brand is “Livetrends.”
5. I like it and I really don’t want to fail it.

176zxnh,1697207037.0,I potted some golden pothos cuttings I took this summer 6th of September and..,".. here they are around a month later. I bought a medium sized pothos this summer, and found it to have root rot. So I took some cuttings, cut off as much rot as I could and repotted the rest of it in a smaller pot. But still no growth, just a lot of grief from it. Checked it and sill rot 2 months later 😑, and only a top cut was viable from it by then, which has been propagated in water and soil the last month. 

From the cuttings I took earlier this summer, they were potted together a month ago.
I would've left them in the 4 inch pot until spring if it wasn't for all the roots poking through the bottom, but they were starting to grow secondary roots and I didn't want to have to damage them getting it out of the pot in spring, so it had to be repotted now. And now I could also fit that top cut I took in the late summer.

Look at them beautiful roots. It's been thriving since I changed from soil+perlite to a chunkier mix, the pothos is an insanely fast rooter, Jesus.",2,6,0.88,houseplants

1778are,1697230015.0,Can a potted hibiscus be moved indoors?,"First time poster here; forgive me if it's stupid or obvious question.  

Since buying a house a couple years ago, this was the first year I put plants outside other than the ones already planted around the house - generally in pots on the porch.   I have had three hibiscus plants since the middle of the summer.  They thrived outside in the sun and warm conditions.  Two different varieties (don't know what they were called).  Two of the plants had bloomed white and the non-flower part of the plant was seemingly less thick and sturdy than the other variety which was darker green and bloomed in red and yellow.  Anyway, the two white hibiscus are looking slightly haggard as it gets colder and the days shorter.  I'll probably toss them and replace them next spring.  But the red/yellow hibiscus still looks great and I was thinking instead of keeping it outside and eventually getting rid of it, I'd move it inside.

So what's the deal?  I'd assume it needs sun and my house gets good sun, though the days are getting very short so even with good internal sun, it may not be optimal. Placed outside, I watered it generally every other day in the peak of summer, sometimes on consecutive days if it was super hot.  Indoors it would need to be watered less?

I put diotomaceous earth on the top of the soil, but it didn’t kill the bugs. Eventually, my wife put it out by the garbage, and had declared it dead, but I thought I’d give it another try at life. My instincts told me to buy new soil, hose off the roots and get rid of 100% of old dirt and bugs. It actually worked, no more bugs! For the past 2 years, it’s been getting tall, 6+ft now,(about 8ft including raised pot) but it still looks a bit droopy and the leaves are folding and has dried tips.

17a6fj6,1697570850.0,I've been keeping houseplants for about five years and around 300 different species! Here's a list of ones that have died on me and what the reason for their passage was:,"* *Asplenium nidus*: overwatering.
* *Alocasia amazonica*: some watering problems. Eventually, it dropped all its leaves. I'd say irregular watering schedule. (?)
* *Alocasia bambino*: The same as above.
* *Asparagus setaceus*: drought.
* *Begonia corallina*: I can't keep a single begonia from dropping its leaves send help.
* *Begonia maculata*: The same as above.
* *Biophytum sensitivum*: low humidity. Tried twice!
* *Calathea makoyana*: spider mites 🕷️🕷️🕷️
* *Calathea orbifolia*: drought.
* *Calathea ornata*: leaves burned from excessive neem oil usage.
* *Calathea veitchiana*: drought.
* *Codiaeum variegatum ""Bush On Fire""*: 100% forgot about it for over a month, sorry mate.
* *Ctenanthe lubbersiana ""Golden Mosaic""*: drought.
* *Maranta fascinator*: I bumped into it and dropped it on the floor.
* *Philodendron ""golden imperial""*: The same as above.
* *Plerandra elegantissima*: I messed up the substrate mixture so that it barely held any moisture.
* *Polyscias fruticosa*: Root rot. It was situated in a ceramic pot without a drainage hole, so there was excess water standing inside the pot.
* *Syngonium podophyllum ""pink allusion""*: I have no clue! Every new growth turned into goo and smelled like sweaty feet.

17a2sxm,1697561394.0,Elephant Ears,Hello! I have an elephant plant and it's leaves are turning yellow then black/brown and there are bulbs in the soil. I moved the plant from a too small pot to a much bigger one today and I'm hoping that will make my plant healthier. There is no root rot but wondering if anyone could tell me what I can do to look after my plant. Thanks:),6,42,0.98,houseplants
179y52q,1697548602.0,First Bloom in 20 years.,"This plant has been through it over the years. It was given to my mom when my grandma passed and has nearly died twice now, been knocked over by cats and dogs a few times too. I've been nursing it back to life for almost 4 years now from a single leaf in a tiny little pit to now it's in a 2 gallon pot and bloomed again for the first time in about 20 years.",2,63,0.99,houseplants

179l2eb,1697501717.0,What plants can I put here?,"

My apartment has this south-facing skylight that is quite close to the floor. Light is on the daybed in the pic but later in the day it moves obviously and is squarely on the other side (where the marble coffee table is). I’d love to have a bunch of plants over there but anything I put there is getting absolutely blasted by the sun and wilts/burns. (I have tried both the snake plant and the palm in the pic over there—it was too much sun for them). Any ideas of what I can put over there that can handle that much sun and heat? I’m in zone 5a, in a mountain town at 9,000 feet.",76,284,0.99,houseplants

also should i repot it? it seems to have good soil unlike ones bought from big shops (not an expert at all though) but there is some roots growing above the soil and i'm not sure if that's normal.
